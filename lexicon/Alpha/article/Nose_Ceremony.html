<h1>Nose Ceremony</h1>
<p>A Nose Ceremony is a rite of passage among the Disquietists.  Young acolytes complete a series of three trials, at the end of which they are presented with a red rubber false nose.  Their acceptance of the nose signifies their progression to the full status of clownhood.  The exact details of the trials depend on the traditions and strictures of the Disquietist school, but typically the acolytes will face a trial of slapstick, a trial of stand-up comedy, and a trial in which they unsettle as many people as they can within a set time period.</p>
<p>Where Nose Ceremonies had traditionally been more freeform, recent years have seen a shift towards greater control by the acolyte's school.  This can be traced to the infamous actions of <a href="Joculus_the_Red.html">Joculus the Red</a>, who, during his Nose Ceremony, murdered eighty people with nothing but an oversized shoe and a cream pie.  In the outrage surrounding the massacre, Disquietist schools were forced to take measures to assure the public such an event would not occur again.  A notable exception is the <a href="Order_of_the_Black_Ladder.html">Order of the Black Ladder</a>, who, true to form, continue to respond to any and all complaints by filling the complainer's room with googly eyes while they sleep.</p>
