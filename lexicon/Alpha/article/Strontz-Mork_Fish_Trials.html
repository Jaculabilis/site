<h1>Strontz-Mork Fish Trials</h1>
<p>The so-called <b>Strontz-Mork Fish Trials</b> were a series of high-profile show trials institaged by enemies of the Disquietists within the Remigrationist camp. The Fish Trials resulted in the house arrests and subsequent political assassinations of <a href="Collected_Writings_and_Letters_of_Ignatius_Clivowycz.html">prominent Disquietist leaders</a>, which were variously blamed on other causes of death. Their characteristic name comes from the inexplicably successful defense, now known as the "Strontz-Mork Defense", that pointed to the victims' dead pet fish as evidence that the deaths had not been assassinations.</p>
<p>While the precise political motive for the Fish Trials remains unknown, "Sloppy Joe", the mysterious benefactor of the Remigrationist-affiliated annual ritual blood sacrifice known as the <a href="Quadrant_Cup.html">Quadrant Cup</a> -- a euphemism for the massive cup situated between the four Quartiles whose true name is <b>Megameat the Doomgoblet</b> [sic] -- has generally been blamed in recent scholarly review of the topic. After all, the method of assassination matches the previous <a href="Genocide_of_the_Second_Quartile.html">Second Quartile Genocide</a>, which is known to have been started by "Sloppy Joe" in retalitation for the sharp drop in attendence caused by Disquietist fanfiction that made fun of the idea of grinding victims into mincemeat and selling them as sandwiches.</p>
