<h1>Collected Writings and Letters of Ignatius Clivowycz</h1>
<p>The <b>Collected Writings and Letters of Ignatius Clivowycz</b> is a slim volume of content
compiled, edited, and self-published by Ignatius Clivowycz, a prominent Disquietist leader
and citizen of the <a href="First_Quartile.html">First Quartile</a>.  Although presented as a compilation of his extant 
writings, scholars now believe that most of the documents were  written specifically for 
this publication.  For one, the flow and development of his arguments over the 
<i>Collected Writings and Letters</i> is suspiciously coherent for a collection of ostensibly 
unrelated content.  For another, most of the letters are addressed to people who do not 
actually exist.</p>
<p>Though undoubtedly a vanity project—it is painfully evident that Clivowycz is trying 
rather too hard to seem wise—historians have found the <i>Collected Writings and Letters</i> 
to be an invaluable historical resource, as Clivowycz's rambling banality belies numerous
pearls of insight into the political events in which he was involved.  Most notable among 
these are his description of his founding of the 
<a href="The_Disquietist_22Circle_of_Fifths22_Revisited.html">Circle of Fifths</a> and his eerily accurate
prediction, not only of the <a href="Genocide_of_the_Second_Quartile.html">Genocide of the Second Quartile</a>, but of the specific
circumstances of his own death in the Genocide.  Various commentators, 
<a href="Petrov_van_der_Deathface.html">Petrov van der Deathface</a> among them, have observed that if Clivowycz knew he was going 
to die on his ill-fated trip to the Second Quartile, he could have chosen not go. Thus, 
they concluded, Clivowycz's death was probably faked to add an air of mystery to the
<i>Collected Writings and Letters</i>.</p>
