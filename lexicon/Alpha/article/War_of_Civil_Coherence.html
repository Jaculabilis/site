<h1>War of Civil Coherence</h1>
<p>The <b>War of Civil Coherence</b> was a conflict primarily between 
<a href="Double-Eighth_Hexadecisection.html">hexadecisections</a> of the <a href="First_Quartile.html">First Quartile</a> and everyone 
else.  It is unclear exactly why the war began, but many contemporary scholars point to 
the escalation of a wide-ranging prank war instigated by the <a href="Order_of_the_Black_Ladder.html">Order of the Black Ladder</a> 
against the emerging Remigrationist movement.  Note that the label "War of Civil 
Coherence" is one insisted upon primarily by First Quartile scholars; among some 
Disquietist schools, it is known as "The Revolution pt. II," a reference to the 
Disquietist dogmatic teaching that all sequels are inevitably social and commercial 
failures.</p>
<p>The war proceeded according to the following pattern, at various scales.  First, anti-
Remigrationist forces would perform a prank or other offense in some area.  Second, First 
Quartile military forces would move to that area and attempt to stamp out resistance.  
Without the benefit of <a href="World_Transfer_Agency.html">World Transfer Agency</a> logistical support, the resistance forces 
either fought (and died), or relocated to start the cycle anew.  </p>
<p>Resistance forces were led by General <a href="Petrov_van_der_Deathface.html">Petrov van der Deathface</a>, who, during the war, 
acquired a reputation as an unparalleled tactical genius.  Though unable to directly halt 
the First Quartile's advance, military historians have noted that he left them 
over-extended to the point where a handful of strategic strikes could have crippled their 
military machine.  Did the grand strategist have a plan to win the war?  Sadly, we may 
never know, as van der Deathface was killed by a stray bullet at the 
<a href="Battle_of_Quillian_Square.html">Battle of Quillian Square</a> while attempting to bait a squad of <a href="Kindergarten_Kops.html">Kindergarten Kops</a> 
into charging their First Quartile allies.  Within weeks of his death, the First Quartile 
declared victory.</p>
