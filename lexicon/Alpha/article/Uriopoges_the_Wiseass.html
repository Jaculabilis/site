<p>In the wake of the Quartile Reformation, you are scholars investigating the influence of Remigrationism on the Disquietists.</p>

<h1>Uriopoges the Wiseass</h1>
<p>Few figures in the history of the Risible Republic can claim to have as much influence as <b>Urion Opogester</b>, the founder of Remigrationism. He is better known by his cultic name, <b>Uriopoges the Wiseass</b>, which he took after his violent expulsion from the Circle of Fifths and subsequent ascension as the high priest of <a href="Teramince2C_Clown-God_of_Slaughter.html">Teramince</a>.</p>
<p>The first note of Opogester in the records of the Clamorous Convosembly is of a secretary with both exceptional eloquence and vehemence. After his election as treasurer, records in the <a href="Transactions_of_the_Clamorous_Convosembly2C_Vol._5.html"><i>Transactions</i></a> indicate that he took advantage of this position to push his agenda of <i>extreme</i> slapstick and thrill pranks in the Convosembly. While Opogester had high-placed figures like Klaus DuKrampus on his side, the oppositon party headed by Undersecretary <a href="The_Disquietist_22Circle_of_Fifths22_Revisited.html">Ignatius Clivowycz</a> succeeded in ousting him on charges of "crimes against clownhood" and banning him from the Convosembly.</p>
<p>These seminal events would lend shape to the often-amorphous doctrines later grouped under the heading of <b>Remigrationism</b>. Preaching the ephemerality of the world and the cyclical nature of our journey through it -- the "remigration" -- Opogester, now Uriopoges, united the sectarian First Quartile around the idea that the cycle of life is a carousel, carousels are more fun if they go faster, and therefore we ought to send people around it as fast as possible.</p>
<p>Uriopoges' crowning achievement, the construction of <a href="Quadrant_Cup.html"><b>Megameat the Doomgoblet</b></a> [sic], was beset by resistance from orthodox and unorthodox Disquietists alike, which ultimately culminated in the <a href="Battle_of_Quillian_Square.html">Battle of Quillian Square</a>, where the Remigrationists were victorious despite heavy losses.</p>
