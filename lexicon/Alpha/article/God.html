<p>In the wake of the Quartile Reformation, you are scholars investigating the influence of Remigrationism on the Disquietists.</p>

<div class="content">
<h1>God</h1>
<p>A being known by all and agreed upon by none. Most widely known for his holy text,
the Rules page. While scholars previously believed God to be largely absent from
the workings of the world, new evidence points to his involvement in many key
events in recent times.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the <a href="Genocide_of_the_Second_Quartile.html">Genocide of the Second Quartile</a>, graffiti has been
seen on various buildings with messages such as "God was here." It is
unclear whether God had a direct influence on the massacre, or if this is
just another attempt by <a href="Joculus_the_Red.html">Joculus the Red</a> to get revenge on God for stealing
his burrito from the office fridge.</p>
<p>God's allegiance has been debated, though evidence suggests he may lean slightly
toward Disquietism. "The First Quartile has most of the resources and power," stated
God, when questioned about the subject, "and the Disquietists, and the Order of
the Black Ladder in particular, are resisting them."</p>
<p>God has been cited numerous times as the divine inspiration for such radical works
as <a href="Uriopoges_the_Wiseass.html">Uriopoges</a>' <a href="Doctrine_of_Imbalance.html">Doctrine of Imbalance</a>, though he continues
to remain silent on these issues.</p>
