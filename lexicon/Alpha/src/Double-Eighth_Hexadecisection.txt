# Title: Double-Eighth Hexadecisection

To some, the Double-Eighth Hexadecisection was a godsend. No longer were there
single big governments ruling over each of the four quartiles, but rather
four smaller governments in place of each original. Some argue that without this
dramatic shift, we would never have seen the fall of the infamous [[Joculus the Red]].

To others, the Double-Eighth Hexadecisection was the single worst piece of
legislation in the history of the quartiles since the [[Penultimate Compact]].
Originally, there was simplicity, a harmony of four governments working together
for the benefit of all. Now, there is chaos, a political frenzy that has rendered
the legislative process obsolete. Initially, some argued that the newly-created
factions such as the [[Circle of Fifths|The Disquietist "Circle of Fifths" Revisited]]
were radical and unorthodox. For reasons unknown, the voices of opposition have
grown quieter over the years.

And to a select few, the Double-Eighth Hexadecisection remains one of many
phrases impossible to say correctly on the first try.
