# Title: The WYZZYIRD

The **Wavelength Yocto-Zig-Zag Yodel Infiltration/Relocation Division**, or **WYZZYIRD** for short, is alleged to be a clandestine military unit operating out of the enigmatic [[Mystery District]] in the Third Quartile. While the scant evidence of their existence (mostly notes from the private journals of Her Quartness Quartilord [[Lega|Lega the Hamhanded]]) is disputed academically only in hushed tones, the WYZZYIRD remains a popular topic of urban legend.

The central narratives of the WYZZYIRD legends claim that its operatives use yodelling at absurdly high frequencies -- their titular "wavelength yocto-zig-zag yodel" -- in order to quantum tunnel through walls or across great distances in order to infiltrate their target's location, where they use their yodelling to suck their target through a wormhole to the dreaded [[Outlands|The Outlands]]. Some allege that the WYZZYIRD is a division of the [[World Transfer Agency]], but as in all things WYZZYIRD, available facts are scant.

One of the most popular variations on the WYZZYIRD urban legend is the claim that [[Joculus the Red]] is one of their operatives. This tall tale is likely inspired by Joculus' boasts about his ability to hide a burrito in any fridge, even fridges unreachable to mortal men, combined with his unsettling track record of having never lied.
