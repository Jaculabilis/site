# Title: Kindergarten Kops

The paramilitary force known as the **Kindergerten Kops** was a brutal enforcement mechanism of 
the Fourth Quartile. With all the power of a mechanized mercenary army and all the diplomatic 
skill of a class of kindergarteners, the mech-piloting toddlers of the Kops painted a bloody 
swath across the chaos of the Reformation.

Full specifications of the Kops' armored chassis were never released to the public, but redacted 
documents detail military-grade armor protecting critical sections such as joints and the 
toddler pilot. Accounts of Kop raids recount several weapon types, including tear gas grenade 
launchers, flamethrowers, gatling guns, and heavy artillery. Reports indicate that their weapons 
were grafted to the chassis' arms, so it is likely that there were several distinct roles within the 
Kindergarten Kops that specialized chassis were designed for.

Eyewitness testimony reports that Kindergarten Kops led the charge at the [[Battle of Quillian Square]] 
that broke the resistance lines and resulted in the deaths of several opposition leaders, including 
[[Petrov van der Deathface]].
