My dear Jay,

I hope this letter finds you well as you prepare for the Thirteenth Annual [[Quadrant Cup]] next month. Unfortunately, I must turn down your speaking request; my research is too pressing at this juncture to engage the week-long ceremonies of the Cup and prepare a lecture for the occasion.

I assume you have already read, or otherwise know about, my recent papers on the "secret doctrines" of Remigrationism. Though I cannot take your offer of a speaking engagement, if you have an afternoon to spare from your unending dispute with [[Ms Legaria|Lega the Hamhanded]], I should be ever so greatful to discuss the recent discoveries with you. We may be much closer than anticipated to uncovering what old Urion, [[God]] rest his soul, knew about the [[Genocide of the Second Quartile]] prior to its occurrence. I have some theories I am eager to share about his relation to [[Clivowycz|Collected Writings and Letters of Ignatius Clivowycz]].

Please send your response to me by letter this time. I have told you several times already: I am not [[Teramince|Teramince, Clown-God of Slaughter]]. I will not receive your response if you send it via prayer, nor will I be aware of its contents if you attach it to a carrier pigeon and toss it into a meat grinder like you did last time.

Your friend,

~ Honorious Rightson, Esq.
