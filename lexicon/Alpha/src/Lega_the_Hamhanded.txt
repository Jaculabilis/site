Following the Quartile Reformation, **Legaria Porkins** saw her rise to power as the
first and current **elected governor of the Third Quartile**. If you've forgotten
that the Third Quartile even exists, that's no accident. Under Porkins'
leadership, the Third Quartile has remained absent from nearly all major Republic
conflicts.

Porkins has taken a strictly neutral stance on Remigrationism, signing nonaggression
pacts with Remigrationist leaders such as [[Uriopoges the Wiseass]] along with resistance
leaders such as [[Petrov van der Deathface]]. In her first address to the Republic
after these pacts, she stated the Third Quartile would not participate in the conflict
in order to devote more time and resources into foosball, the Quartile's national sport.

Porkins is known to participate in competitive kickboxing. Many claim she has used
fist-enlarging drugs to get an edge against her rival, the [[Hand of Justice]] in
the ring. This conspiracy, along with an unfortunately exploitable surname,
has left her with the nickname **Lega the Hamhanded**. Her supporters deny
all allegations, but have refused to comment when questioned with the fact that
despite over 200 public broadcasts, Porkins' hands have //never once appeared on
camera//. Coincidence? Just think about it.
