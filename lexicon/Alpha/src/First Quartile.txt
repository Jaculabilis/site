# Title: First Quartile

The **First Quartile** is one of four Quartiles that comprise the Risible Republic.  It 
enjoys a somewhat advantaged position over the other three Quartiles in Republic politics.  
Analysts attribute this mostly to force projection abilities: the [[World Transfer Agency]], 
based primarily in the First Quartile, has shifted significantly pro-First Quartile in 
recent years.  Due to the First Quartile's central position in the Republic, both 
geographically and politically, it has accumulated no small amount of cultural influence 
as well.  This can be seen most prominently in the recent growth of Remigrationism in 
Disquietist circles.

The national deity of the First Quartile is [[Teramince, Clown-God of Slaughter]].  This 
state of affairs has caused no small amount of consternation among the other Quartiles, 
particularly over such phrases in Teramince's holy book as "Go forth among the infidels 
and harvest bloodily their precious, precious organs"â€”a command which the First Quartile 
administration officially claims is a metaphor.  That said, some scholars have noted that 
the waitlist for organ donations is significantly shorter in the First Quartile, even 
after controlling for population and socio-economic status.  The controversy is ongoing at 
the time of writing.

The First Quartile boasts its share of notable personages.  These include such figures as 
spiritual leader [[Uriopoges the Wiseass]], noted as the founder of Remigrationism; the 
kickboxer known as the [[Hand of Justice]], who claims to be a prophet of Teramince; and 
[[Petrov van der Deathface]], despite his attempts to eradicate all traces of his past.
