Okay, we get it. Deathface //allegedly// single-handedly wiped out no less than
twenty two [[Kops|Kindergarten Kops]] in the [[Battle of Quillian Square]]. Deathface
has a kill count greater than every other [[First Quartile]] soldier's, combined.
We get it, Deathface was a legendary war hero. The glory of his mustache rivaled
that of Mustachius, the highest of the mustache dieties. But have you ever stopped
to think about how ridiculous those stories are? One single man, accomplishing all
Deathface did in his tragically short-lived life? It's preposterous! The man named
**Petrov van der Deathface** is nothing but a //sham//, a marketing ploy to sell
more t-shirts!

Not convinced? Then perhaps consider the fact that Deathface does not have a face.
Everyone knows that real people have faces. Therefore, Petrov van der Deathface
is not a real person. Q. E. Motherfucking. D.

Grab a copy of the [[Doctrine of Imbalance]] from your local library and give it
a read. It explicitly states in there that Deathface is but a myth. Or something
similar, anyways. Point is, you've all been had! Open your eyes and don't give
into this scam!
