# Title: Circus Moon

In Disquietist folk tales, the "Circus Moon" heralds the arrival of [[Teramince|Teramince, Clown-God of Slaughter]] to the physical world. According to other myths, the light reflected from the moon itself is (by means curiously unspecified) sufficient to provide a form for Teramince's body. Accounts of the Circus Moon's appearance vary greatly, but commonly speak of a "stretching" or "warping", as if by a funhouse mirror. According to legend, its appearence is usually accompanied by corvids emitting the occasional "Wilhelm Scream."

Because no photographs exist of the Circus Moon and that no physical explanation has been offered for its appearance, it is clear that the Circus Moon is little more than a Disquietist fiction. Nonetheless, the tales appear to influence a great number of Disquietist traditions: even the [[Order of the Black Ladder]] will quickly assemble for an impromptu barbequeue in the event of a supposed sighting.
