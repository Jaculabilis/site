# Title: Transactions of the Clamorous Convosembly, Vol. 5

The **Transactions of the Clamorous Convosembly**, known more concisely as the 
**Transactions**, are a set of volumes detailing the running expenses of the 
Clamorous Convosembly.  The vast majority of these volumes are of minimal historical 
interest, detailing such mundane matters as catering costs and reimbursements for prank 
supplies (this last to be expected from any institutionalized gathering of Disquietists).  
However, Volume 5 of the //Transactions// has taken on disproportionate significance
among historians.  Volume 5 was compiled during the [[Uriopoges the Wiseass]]'s tragically 
short-lived tenure as Convosembly treasurer and member of the Circle of Fifths.  

Uriopoges, who is recognized mostly for his role as the founder of Remigrationism, had a 
habit of making comments in the margins of the //Transactions//, ranging from insults 
about other Convosembly members, to commentary on the proceedings, to moral statements 
that foreshadow his later teachings.  Contemporary scholars have focused particularly on 
what have been termed his "Five-Hundred Injunctions," which mostly rage against the 
practices of the [[Order of the Black Ladder]].  However, when constructing their 
interpretations, these scholars tend to ignore that the Injunctions were written alongside
a truly epic list of prank reimbursements to Hisaguru the Silent, then-current head of the
Order.  It should require only elementary reasoning to understand what might have made 
Uriopoges so angry about this particular set of pranks.

Unfortunately, emphasis on the Injunctions has served to draw attention away from other
teachings first elucidated in the //Transactions//, such as his [[Doctrine of Imbalance]] 
and the Parable of the Bird Thief.
