# Title: Chloroveritase

**Chloroveritase** is a substance exuded by [[gattling ducks|Gattling ducks]] during weapon discharge. Despite its humble origins as a byproduct of avian assault troops, chloroveritase has become an immensely important substance due to its curious ability to make things see-through. It sees use by the [[World Transfer Agency]] as a screening method, which has caused some controversy given that the see-through effect sometimes does not wear off, causing transferred persons grief when their clothes or skin is made permanently transparent.

Though [[Petrov van der Deathface]]'s eponymous condition is officially attributed by the resistance to WTA malice, no known WTA procedure applies chloroveritase only to the facial skin and muscle, and so despite the popular appeal of such stories, scholars generally consider it to have been self-inflicted for political reasons.
