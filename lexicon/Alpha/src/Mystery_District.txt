# Title: Mystery District

In every map made of the Republic, on the far side of the Third Quartile, there
is a small sector conspicuously missing. On some maps, you might see it labeled
the **Mystery District**, though this is simply a name given to the region by
fans of conspiracies surrounding it.

Due to massive walls bordering the district and an estimated 250 personnel on
patrol around the perimeter, no one from outside the district has ever been
inside. As such, absolutely nothing is known about its purpose. Conspirators
have their theories, however:

- As the Mystery District lies on the outer boundary of the Republic, many have
speculated ties to [[The Outlands]]. Some believe [[The WYZZYIRD]] is involved
in the district as well, but no one who has furthered this theory has ever
been heard from again.

- Perhaps a more reasonable theory is that of resistance leader
[[Petrov van der Deathface]], who believes the district to be the secret cult
worshipping grounds of the [[Clown-God of Slaughter|Teramince, Clown-God of Slaughter]].

- Third Quartile officials have assured the public that there is nothing suspicious
going on in the district, but of course one should take these assurances with
a grain of salt.

Three months ago, [[First Quartile]] leaders said they were preparing an
investigation into the Mystery District, but no action has been taken by them
since then.
