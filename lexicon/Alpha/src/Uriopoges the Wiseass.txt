# Title: Uriopoges the Wiseass

Few figures in the history of the Risible Republic can claim to have as much influence as **Urion Opogester**, the founder of Remigrationism. He is better known by his cultic name, **Uriopoges the Wiseass**, which he took after his violent expulsion from the Circle of Fifths and subsequent ascension as the high priest of [[Teramince|Teramince, Clown-God of Slaughter]].

The first note of Opogester in the records of the Clamorous Convosembly is of a secretary with both exceptional eloquence and vehemence. After his election as treasurer, records in the [[//Transactions//|Transactions of the Clamorous Convosembly, Vol. 5]] indicate that he took advantage of this position to push his agenda of //extreme// slapstick and thrill pranks in the Convosembly. While Opogester had high-placed figures like Klaus DuKrampus on his side, the oppositon party headed by Undersecretary [[Ignatius Clivowycz|The Disquietist "Circle of Fifths" Revisited]] succeeded in ousting him on charges of "crimes against clownhood" and banning him from the Convosembly.

These seminal events would lend shape to the often-amorphous doctrines later grouped under the heading of **Remigrationism**. Preaching the ephemerality of the world and the cyclical nature of our journey through it -- the "remigration" -- Opogester, now Uriopoges, united the sectarian First Quartile around the idea that the cycle of life is a carousel, carousels are more fun if they go faster, and therefore we ought to send people around it as fast as possible.

Uriopoges' crowning achievement, the construction of [[**Megameat the Doomgoblet**|Quadrant Cup]] [sic], was beset by resistance from orthodox and unorthodox Disquietists alike, which ultimately culminated in the [[Battle of Quillian Square]], where the Remigrationists were victorious despite heavy losses.
