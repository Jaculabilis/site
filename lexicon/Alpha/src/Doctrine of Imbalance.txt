# Title: Doctrine of Imbalance

The **Doctrine of Imbalance** of Uriopoges the Wiseass is one of the so-called "secret doctrines" of Remigrationism. It was unknown to Remigrationism scholarship until the recent discovery that the Five-Hundred Injunctions found in the [[//Transactions//|Transactions of the Clamorous Convosembly, Vol. 5]] spell out an acrostic message. This was likely overlooked for so long because of the marginal nature of the //Transactions//. Initial reactions were highly skeptical -- the Injunctions are hurried marginal notes, after all -- but the improbability has convinced the field that the Doctrine is legitimate and inspired a search for other hidden doctrines in Uriopoges' writings.

In relation to other Remigrationist doctrines, the Doctrine of Imbalance qualifies the idea of the cycle of life to suggest that the distribution of souls in the cycle is not even, but is heavily concentrated to one side. It does not figure largely into public Remigrationist discourse, leaving the question open as to how much significance it could possibly have and raising questions about why Uriopoges went to such lengths to hide it in the //Transactions//.

While the tall tales of the "secret doctrines" certainly add that //je ne sais quoi// to the otherwise revolting doctrines of Remigrationism, it is in my opinion an unprofitable avenue of Remigrationist scholarship that distracts from more pressing issues, such as [[Rightson's|Honorius Rightson]] excellent recent essay on the proposals for a Reformed Remigrationism put forth by [[Joculus the Red]] in his latest essay-length graffiti on the walls of the [[Mystery District]].
