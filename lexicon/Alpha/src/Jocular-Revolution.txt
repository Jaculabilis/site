# Title: The Jocular Revolution

The [[Jocular Revolution|The Jocular Revolution]] is the name being used for the sudden upheaval of the past 
few days.  [[Joculus the Red]] has apparently returned, leading operatives who some claim are 
[[The WYZZYIRD]], to overthrow **Megameat the Doomgoblet** [sic] and restore balance to 
the Quartiles.  I've seen reports that [[Petrov van der Deathface]] is among them.  
[[Uriopoges the Wiseass]] has apparently been slain in combat, and 
[[Teramince|Teramince, Clown-God of Slaughter]] manifested only to be yodeled into 
[[The Outlands]].  Information is currently vague, hard to come by, and contradictory, but 
if even a fraction of these reports are true, the very course of history is changing as I 
pen these words.

May a brighter future await us.
