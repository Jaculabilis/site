# Title: Teramince, Clown-God of Slaughter

According to canon, Teramince ascended over the former Clown-God of Slaughter,
Gigamince, by baking him into a casserole of cosmic proportions and eating
him to gain his power. Once a year, recalling her hilarious feast, Teramince's
sanguine hunger waxes, and wanes only with a leviathan sip of the
[[Quadrant Cup]].

On this occasion, Teramince takes physical form from the shadows cast by the
[[Circus Moon]] in order to walk amidst mortals and record flavor notes for
her annual people-tasting. Although unconfirmed by any written report, [[Uriopoges|Uriopoges the Wiseass]] is fabled to have become her high priest after offering her a nibble of his index finger, whereupon she pronounced him "...a man of excellent taste and flavor."
