The **Right Honorable Honorius Rightson, Esq., PrR, WKD** is a prominent scholar of 
Disquietist history and culture.  His early life was spent in the Third Quartile, but he 
soon moved to the University of Haven Rock in the [[First Quartile]] to pursue a career in 
scholarship.  He received the degree of Practitioner of the Rock for his thesis, 
"The Implications of Grammatical Irregularities in [[Opogester's|Uriopoges the Wiseass]] 
[[//Transactions//|Transactions of the Clamorous Convosembly, Vol. 5]]."  After 
only three years of apprenticeship, he claimed the title of Wise Knower of Doctrine in 
the traditional way (that is, besting his former mentor in single combat and seizing his 
mentor's title), thereby gaining full professership.  

Rightson's scholarly work of late has focused on Remigrationism as a cultural force, 
particularly with respect to its impact on Disquietism.  Of particular note is his work 
with Jay Gubbins, the self-proclaimed prophet of 
[[Teramince|Teramince, Clown-God of Slaughter]] and self-styled [[Hand of Justice]].  
Although Rightson's research was able to provide valuable insight into Remigrationism, 
Gubbins's instability led him to believe that Rightson was Teramince himself.  
Because of Gubbins's influence in Remigrationist circles, it is not unusual for them to 
think Rightson is their [[god|God]] in disguise, and he is often invoked in the rites 
surrounding the [[Quadrant Cup]].

In honor of the sacrifices he has made in the line of his scholarly duties, this 
Encyclopedia is dedicated to him.
