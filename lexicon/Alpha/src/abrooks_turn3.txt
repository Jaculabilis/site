# Title: Joculus the Red

Joculus the Red was an influential and infamous Disquietist known principally for his fateful [[Nose Ceremony]] massacre.
Even from an early age, Joculus was alarmingly incapable of differentiating jokes from savage transgressions against God and humanity alike.
Subsequent research suggests that this was likely due to accumulated exposure to trace amounts of [[chloroveritase]] as a toddler, which provoked hypersensitivity
of his ulnar nerve. The Antifestivites vilified him, recounting his tasteless "jokes" in support of the [[remigration|Trek and Remigration of the Antifestivites]].

//Among his odious "pranks" gone awry://

**-** Ruining the fifth [[Quadrant Cup]] by substituting sugar for baking soda in the Sloppy Joe's industrial cookbook

**-** Defusing the world's entire supply of exploding cigars

**-** Bankrupting the First Quadrant's premier restaurant franchise by exploiting its "unlimited breadsticks" policy

**-** Leaving an outstanding library fine unpaid

**-** Signing his name as "Jacklus ;)" in the [[Order of the Black Ladder]] guestbook

**-** Mixing tabs and spaces

**-** Wearing, simultaneously, striped socks and plaid pajamas (later punishable by death in the second quartile)

Let us never speak of him again!
