and that's where you come in!//

//Close one eye, and wink into the twinkling eyes of [[Urion Opogester|Uriopoges the Wiseass]]. Now
close 'em both and race headfirst into// **Megameat**//'s gaping maw, champ! You'll make
[[Honorious Rightson|Honorius Rightson]] proud!//

//You've had //your// sip of life, and now it's time for life to sip back. Oh, come on now... you wouldn't want to Megameat to summon the [[Kops|Kindergarten Kops]]...//
