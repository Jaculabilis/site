# Title: Genocide of the Second Quartile

Following the conclusion of the [[Double-Eighth Hexadecisection]], most
quartiles resorted to controversal means of achieving their political goals. Most shocking among them is the **Genocide of the Second Quartile**, provoked by a particularly detestable, pun-laden Disquietist fan fiction.

The genocide began swiftly, with the introduction of reams of paperwork into
the dwellings of anyone sporting a [[Red Nose|Nose Ceremony]]. Crippled
by their life-long instruction in carefree japery, the Disquietists were unable
to cope, and most passed away before the filing deadline. 
[[Subsequent experiments with fish|Strontz-Mork Fish Trials]] indicate that fish subjected
to life with 10kg of paperwork in their habitat tend to quickly suffocate or
die of starvation. A similar biological process is thought to be responsible
for the near extinction of the Disquietists from the second quartile.
