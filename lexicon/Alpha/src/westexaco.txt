Westexico is a province on the other side of [[First Quartile]] that serves as
[[God]]'s burrito orchard. While it is generally respected that [[God]]'s
burrito recipe is simply //divine//, few other sentient entities have the
sophisticated resources or knowledge necessary to construct a suitable tree to
produce them, like [[God]] intended.

Because of the logistical problems presented by tunnelling to the other side
of the continent, burritos are a very scare resource. This scarcity makes them a
natural choice for currency in the four Quartiles, accepted anywhere in the Quartiles following the
[[Penultimate Compact]]. Their use as currency has a few peculiar consequences -- first,
that price of a burrito is as unchanging as [[God]] himself; and second, that one's want for
money grows proportionally with their hunger.

Some conjecture that [[The WYZZYIRD]], if it exists, is naught but a get-rich-quick scheme
with the eventual goal of exfiltrating [[God]]'s entire Westexican Reserve, ordinarily shared
only with his elect. Similarly, there exist rumors of the [[Hand of Justice]] plotting a
similar heist.
