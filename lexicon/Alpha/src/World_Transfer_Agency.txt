**Overview**

The World Transfer Agency (WTA) is the organization that handles all permanent relocation
of persons and goods across quartiles. Though its methods have been questioned by naysayers,
it is responsible for the continued security and well-being of every citizen in our glorious
[[First Quartile]].

**Controversy**

The WTA has been the center of debate amongst members of all quartiles. Most often cited is
the organization's use of [[chloroveritase]] to screen migrants for weapons and other
dangerous materials. It is without a doubt, however, that the chemical's use is more
efficient than any other proposed method.
