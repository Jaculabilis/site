# Title: The Disquietist "Circle of Fifths" Revisited

Although the beginnings of the Disquietist revolution are unclear, many
  scholars attribute the movement to would-be Disquietist Convosembly leader
  Ignatius Clivowycz' refusal to comply with a demand to "...turn the damned
  music down", supposedly issued by his superior officer, Klaus DuKrampus. This
  explanation is corroborated by the earliest proceedings of the Convosembly,
  which outlines the formation of the governing "Circle of Fifths," responsible
  for the authorship of the infamous "Five-Hundred Injunctions."
  ([[Transactions of the Clamorous Convosembly, Vol. 5]])

While the adumbral Circle is considered inseparable from the movement itself,
  Clivowycz' recently-discovered personal correspondence suggests that it may
  never have been formed for ideological reasons, but simple personal gain.
  Following the Quartile Reformation and its natural extensions, the Tertile
  Revival and Quintile Quandary, Clivowycz claims that he proposed the
  Circle with the intention of "... [leveraging] popular sentiment... to
  place [himself] in control of a world-governing cabal" when writing to his
  sole nephew ([[Collected Writings and Letters of Ignatius Clivowycz]]).
  Furthermore, this suggests that the puzzling Disquietist fascination with
  small primes is not a philosophical obsession, but rather a strategy to
  bolster public appeal.
