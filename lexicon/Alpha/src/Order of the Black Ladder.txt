# Title: Order of the Black Ladder

The **Order of the Black Ladder** is an illustrious Disquietist school and quite possibly the most unorthodox. Despite pressure from the Circle of Fifths, the Order has maintained its status as the most unpredictable of the post-Reformation schools. Recent work by cryptoarchaeologists has unearthed evidence that Order meddling was responsible for the prank war whose escalation eventually resulted in the [[Battle of Quillian Square]], making them the second-deadliest Disquietist school by body count.

Black Ladder unorthodoxy has resulted in a number of bitter feuds with the more traditional Disquietists that control the Circle. One notable example is their stance on the [[World Transfer Agency]]: while traditional Disquietism has variously opposed or abetted the WTA, Black Ladder acolytes tend to view it with indifference, going so far as to gain employment in it only to abuse their security credentials for pranks. This and other conflicts characterize the Order's relationship to Disquietism at large (virtually all of the Injunctions found in [[Volume 5 of the //Transactions//|Transactions of the Clamorous Convosembly, Vol. 5]] are against Order practices).
