# Title: Trek and Remigration of the Antifestivites

Among those who believe in remigrationism are the **Antifestivities**, a
less-extreme group known for their condemnation of practices encouraged by
[[Joculus the Red]]. Although they insist that they're "nothing like those
idiots," leveraging the fact that they do not worship the
[[Clown-God|Teramince, Clown-God of Slaughter]], they are usually lumped together
with the rest of the Disquietists.

The Antifestivities participate in the ongoing remigration, but where are they
migrating to? Some believe they are preparing to take back their homeland, a party
store in the southern parts of the [[First Quartile]] which used to serve as their
office headquarters before the Quartile Reformation. Their name, the //Antifestivities//,
is misleading; many people mistakenly believe they are against festivities in general.
In reality, though, items such as beer, tortilla chips, and pizza delivery coupons
account for over half of what they take with them on their journeys.
