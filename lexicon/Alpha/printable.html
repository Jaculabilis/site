<h2>The Disquietist "Circle of Fifths" Revisited</h2>
<p>Although the beginnings of the Disquietist revolution are unclear, many
  scholars attribute the movement to would-be Disquietist Convosembly leader
  Ignatius Clivowycz' refusal to comply with a demand to "...turn the damned
  music down", supposedly issued by his superior officer, Klaus DuKrampus. This
  explanation is corroborated by the earliest proceedings of the Convosembly,
  which outlines the formation of the governing "Circle of Fifths," responsible
  for the authorship of the infamous "Five-Hundred Injunctions."
  (Transactions of the Clamorous Convosembly, Vol. 5<sup>1</sup>)</p></div>
<p>While the adumbral Circle is considered inseparable from the movement itself,
  Clivowycz' recently-discovered personal correspondence suggests that it may
  never have been formed for ideological reasons, but simple personal gain.
  Following the Quartile Reformation and its natural extensions, the Tertile
  Revival and Quintile Quandary, Clivowycz claims that he proposed the
  Circle with the intention of "... [leveraging] popular sentiment... to
  place [himself] in control of a world-governing cabal" when writing to his
  sole nephew (Collected Writings and Letters of Ignatius Clivowycz<sup>2</sup>).
  Furthermore, this suggests that the puzzling Disquietist fascination with
  small primes is not a philosophical obsession, but rather a strategy to
  bolster public appeal.</p>

<h2>Kindergarten Kops</h2>
<p>The paramilitary force known as the <b>Kindergerten Kops</b> was a brutal enforcement mechanism of 
the Fourth Quartile. With all the power of a mechanized mercenary army and all the diplomatic 
skill of a class of kindergarteners, the mech-piloting toddlers of the Kops painted a bloody 
swath across the chaos of the Reformation.</p></div>
<p>Full specifications of the Kops' armored chassis were never released to the public, but redacted 
documents detail military-grade armor protecting critical sections such as joints and the 
toddler pilot. Accounts of Kop raids recount several weapon types, including tear gas grenade 
launchers, flamethrowers, gatling guns, and heavy artillery. Reports indicate that their weapons 
were grafted to the chassis' arms, so it is likely that there were several distinct roles within the 
Kindergarten Kops that specialized chassis were designed for.</p>
<p>Eyewitness testimony reports that Kindergarten Kops led the charge at the Battle of Quillian Square<sup>1</sup> 
that broke the resistance lines and resulted in the deaths of several opposition leaders, including 
Petrov van der Deathface<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<h2>Nose Ceremony</h2>
<p>A Nose Ceremony is a rite of passage among the Disquietists.  Young acolytes complete a series of three trials, at the end of which they are presented with a red rubber false nose.  Their acceptance of the nose signifies their progression to the full status of clownhood.  The exact details of the trials depend on the traditions and strictures of the Disquietist school, but typically the acolytes will face a trial of slapstick, a trial of stand-up comedy, and a trial in which they unsettle as many people as they can within a set time period.</p></div>
<p>Where Nose Ceremonies had traditionally been more freeform, recent years have seen a shift towards greater control by the acolyte's school.  This can be traced to the infamous actions of Joculus the Red<sup>1</sup>, who, during his Nose Ceremony, murdered eighty people with nothing but an oversized shoe and a cream pie.  In the outrage surrounding the massacre, Disquietist schools were forced to take measures to assure the public such an event would not occur again.  A notable exception is the Order of the Black Ladder<sup>2</sup>, who, true to form, continue to respond to any and all complaints by filling the complainer's room with googly eyes while they sleep.</p>

<h2>World Transfer Agency</h2>
<p><b>Overview</b></p></div>
<p>The World Transfer Agency (WTA) is the organization that handles all permanent relocation
of persons and goods across quartiles. Though its methods have been questioned by naysayers,
it is responsible for the continued security and well-being of every citizen in our glorious
First Quartile<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p><b>Controversy</b></p>
<p>The WTA has been the center of debate amongst members of all quartiles. Most often cited is
the organization's use of chloroveritase<sup>2</sup> to screen migrants for weapons and other
dangerous materials. It is without a doubt, however, that the chemical's use is more
efficient than any other proposed method.</p>

<h2>Battle of Quillian Square</h2>
<p>Quillian Square: birthplace of the "Sloppy Joe" and hometown of military
general Septimus the Eighth. Now a destitute nuclear wasteland, thanks to some
kids and a personal grudge. Since I don't get paid enough to cover any of the
important battles, I'll take the opportunity to set the facts straight on what
did and did not happen in the Battle of Quillian Square.</p></div>
<p><b>What happened?</b></p>
<p>• The square was ransacked by a group of mechanized infants known as the Kindergarten Kops<sup>1</sup>.
It is unclear what the motive was behind the attack, but expert witness
"Sloppy" Joe believes it was a pitiful attempt to challenge
the monopoly of the Sloppy Joe on the sandwich market.</p>
<p>• The Battle of Quillian Square featured the first, and only, ever recorded use of
gattling ducks<sup>2</sup> in military warfare.</p>
<p><b>What did not happen?</b></p>
<p>• First Quartile military control was <i>not</i> reduced in Quillian Square or any
surrounding area as a result of the battle.</p>
<p>• Radiation from the battle has <i>not</i> had any affect on the nutritional value of
Sloppy Joes.</p>
<p>The Battle of Quillian Square saw a great, thriving town reduced to rubble and
ruins, although sources suggest you can still purchase a Sloppy Joe from
Sloppy Joe's, only 5.99!</p>

<h2>Genocide of the Second Quartile</h2>
<p>Following the conclusion of the Double-Eighth Hexadecisection<sup>1</sup>, most
quartiles resorted to controversal means of achieving their political goals. Most shocking among them is the <b>Genocide of the Second Quartile</b>, provoked by a particularly detestable, pun-laden Disquietist fan fiction.</p></div>
<p>The genocide began swiftly, with the introduction of reams of paperwork into
the dwellings of anyone sporting a Red Nose<sup>2</sup>. Crippled
by their life-long instruction in carefree japery, the Disquietists were unable
to cope, and most passed away before the filing deadline. 
Subsequent experiments with fish<sup>3</sup> indicate that fish subjected
to life with 10kg of paperwork in their habitat tend to quickly suffocate or
die of starvation. A similar biological process is thought to be responsible
for the near extinction of the Disquietists from the second quartile.</p>

<h2>Order of the Black Ladder</h2>
<p>The <b>Order of the Black Ladder</b> is an illustrious Disquietist school and quite possibly the most unorthodox. Despite pressure from the Circle of Fifths, the Order has maintained its status as the most unpredictable of the post-Reformation schools. Recent work by cryptoarchaeologists has unearthed evidence that Order meddling was responsible for the prank war whose escalation eventually resulted in the Battle of Quillian Square<sup>1</sup>, making them the second-deadliest Disquietist school by body count.</p></div>
<p>Black Ladder unorthodoxy has resulted in a number of bitter feuds with the more traditional Disquietists that control the Circle. One notable example is their stance on the World Transfer Agency<sup>2</sup>: while traditional Disquietism has variously opposed or abetted the WTA, Black Ladder acolytes tend to view it with indifference, going so far as to gain employment in it only to abuse their security credentials for pranks. This and other conflicts characterize the Order's relationship to Disquietism at large (virtually all of the Injunctions found in Volume 5 of the <i>Transactions</i><sup>3</sup> are against Order practices).</p>

<h2>Penultimate Compact</h2>
<p>The <b>Penultimate Compact</b> was a civil and religious agreement which marked the founding of the Risible Republic.  It divided the Republic's terrain into several semi-autonomous administrative regions, with each region optimized for a specific economic activity.  It was originally known as the "Ultimate Compact," reflecting the contemporaneous belief that the Compact would result in a perfect society with no further need for change.  However, the initial design of the Republic resulted in an outbreak of sectarianism, which culminated in the Quartile Reformation and the utter destruction of all but four of the Republic's administrative regions.  The first use of the name "Penultimate Compact" was by Lega the Hamhanded<sup>1</sup> in her inaugural address.</p></div>
<p>Certain features of the original Compact have persisted to the current day.  Most obviously are the Quartiles, the four surviving remnants of the original administrative regions.  The post-Reformation Compact also preserved the World Transfer Agency<sup>2</sup>, in order to secure the Republic's ability to transport personnel and materials across the radioactive wastes of former regions.  The WTA was originally distributed across the Republic, but post-Reformation, the bulk of its assets were concentrated in the First Quartile<sup>3</sup>.</p>

<h2>Double-Eighth Hexadecisection</h2>
<p>To some, the Double-Eighth Hexadecisection was a godsend. No longer were there
single big governments ruling over each of the four quartiles, but rather
four smaller governments in place of each original. Some argue that without this
dramatic shift, we would never have seen the fall of the infamous Joculus the Red<sup>1</sup>.</p></div>
<p>To others, the Double-Eighth Hexadecisection was the single worst piece of
legislation in the history of the quartiles since the Penultimate Compact<sup>2</sup>.
Originally, there was simplicity, a harmony of four governments working together
for the benefit of all. Now, there is chaos, a political frenzy that has rendered
the legislative process obsolete. Initially, some argued that the newly-created
factions such as the Circle of Fifths<sup>3</sup>
were radical and unorthodox. For reasons unknown, the voices of opposition have
grown quieter over the years.</p>
<p>And to a select few, the Double-Eighth Hexadecisection remains one of many
phrases impossible to say correctly on the first try.</p>

<h2>Joculus the Red</h2>
<p>Joculus the Red was an influential and infamous Disquietist known principally for his fateful Nose Ceremony<sup>1</sup> massacre.
Even from an early age, Joculus was alarmingly incapable of differentiating jokes from savage transgressions against God and humanity alike.
Subsequent research suggests that this was likely due to accumulated exposure to trace amounts of chloroveritase<sup>2</sup> as a toddler, which provoked hypersensitivity
of his ulnar nerve. The Antifestivites vilified him, recounting his tasteless "jokes" in support of the remigration<sup>3</sup>.</p></div>
<p><i>Among his odious "pranks" gone awry:</i></p>
<p><b>-</b> Ruining the fifth Quadrant Cup<sup>4</sup> by substituting sugar for baking soda in the Sloppy Joe's industrial cookbook</p>
<p><b>-</b> Defusing the world's entire supply of exploding cigars</p>
<p><b>-</b> Bankrupting the First Quadrant's premier restaurant franchise by exploiting its "unlimited breadsticks" policy</p>
<p><b>-</b> Leaving an outstanding library fine unpaid</p>
<p><b>-</b> Signing his name as "Jacklus ;)" in the Order of the Black Ladder<sup>5</sup> guestbook</p>
<p><b>-</b> Mixing tabs and spaces</p>
<p><b>-</b> Wearing, simultaneously, striped socks and plaid pajamas (later punishable by death in the second quartile)</p>

<h2>Strontz-Mork Fish Trials</h2>
<p>The so-called <b>Strontz-Mork Fish Trials</b> were a series of high-profile show trials institaged by enemies of the Disquietists within the Remigrationist camp. The Fish Trials resulted in the house arrests and subsequent political assassinations of prominent Disquietist leaders<sup>1</sup>, which were variously blamed on other causes of death. Their characteristic name comes from the inexplicably successful defense, now known as the "Strontz-Mork Defense", that pointed to the victims' dead pet fish as evidence that the deaths had not been assassinations.</p></div>
<p>While the precise political motive for the Fish Trials remains unknown, "Sloppy Joe", the mysterious benefactor of the Remigrationist-affiliated annual ritual blood sacrifice known as the Quadrant Cup<sup>2</sup> -- a euphemism for the massive cup situated between the four Quartiles whose true name is <b>Megameat the Doomgoblet</b> [sic] -- has generally been blamed in recent scholarly review of the topic. After all, the method of assassination matches the previous Second Quartile Genocide<sup>3</sup>, which is known to have been started by "Sloppy Joe" in retalitation for the sharp drop in attendence caused by Disquietist fanfiction that made fun of the idea of grinding victims into mincemeat and selling them as sandwiches.</p>

<h2>Transactions of the Clamorous Convosembly, Vol. 5</h2>
<p>The <b>Transactions of the Clamorous Convosembly</b>, known more concisely as the 
<b>Transactions</b>, are a set of volumes detailing the running expenses of the 
Clamorous Convosembly.  The vast majority of these volumes are of minimal historical 
interest, detailing such mundane matters as catering costs and reimbursements for prank 
supplies (this last to be expected from any institutionalized gathering of Disquietists).  
However, Volume 5 of the <i>Transactions</i> has taken on disproportionate significance
among historians.  Volume 5 was compiled during the Uriopoges the Wiseass<sup>1</sup>'s tragically 
short-lived tenure as Convosembly treasurer and member of the Circle of Fifths.  </p></div>
<p>Uriopoges, who is recognized mostly for his role as the founder of Remigrationism, had a 
habit of making comments in the margins of the <i>Transactions</i>, ranging from insults 
about other Convosembly members, to commentary on the proceedings, to moral statements 
that foreshadow his later teachings.  Contemporary scholars have focused particularly on 
what have been termed his "Five-Hundred Injunctions," which mostly rage against the 
practices of the Order of the Black Ladder<sup>2</sup>.  However, when constructing their 
interpretations, these scholars tend to ignore that the Injunctions were written alongside
a truly epic list of prank reimbursements to Hisaguru the Silent, then-current head of the
Order.  It should require only elementary reasoning to understand what might have made 
Uriopoges so angry about this particular set of pranks.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, emphasis on the Injunctions has served to draw attention away from other
teachings first elucidated in the <i>Transactions</i>, such as his Doctrine of Imbalance<sup>3</sup> 
and the Parable of the Bird Thief.</p>

<h2>God</h2>
<p>A being known by all and agreed upon by none. Most widely known for his holy text,
the Rules page. While scholars previously believed God to be largely absent from
the workings of the world, new evidence points to his involvement in many key
events in recent times.</p></div>
<p>In the aftermath of the Genocide of the Second Quartile<sup>1</sup>, graffiti has been
seen on various buildings with messages such as "God was here." It is
unclear whether God had a direct influence on the massacre, or if this is
just another attempt by Joculus the Red<sup>2</sup> to get revenge on God for stealing
his burrito from the office fridge.</p>
<p>God's allegiance has been debated, though evidence suggests he may lean slightly
toward Disquietism. "The First Quartile has most of the resources and power," stated
God, when questioned about the subject, "and the Disquietists, and the Order of
the Black Ladder in particular, are resisting them."</p>
<p>God has been cited numerous times as the divine inspiration for such radical works
as Uriopoges<sup>3</sup>' Doctrine of Imbalance<sup>4</sup>, though he continues
to remain silent on these issues.</p>

<h2>The Outlands</h2>
<p>Far past the edges of the quartiles, three blocks down from the neighborhood of
infinity, the Outlands are rumored to stretch. Those who the Outlands took,
the Outlands took forever.</p></div>
<p>Leaving the Outlands poses a considerable challenge. All the landscapes are
filmed in portrait. You can only turn left. The ping times are abysmal, and the
sun keeps burning out. Some wonder, licking bitter dew from the leaves of the
refutrees for sustenance, but they'll never leave.</p>
<p><i>Staying</i> in the Outlands is no better. The lice are the size of shoes and the
only mixed drinks are rum and coke. As a courtesy to the wayward prisoner,
there is the occasional quantity of maple syrup, but only enough to make one's
sleeve sticky.</p>
<p>It is unclear who takes people to the Outlands, but the daring few who would
posit a guess universally blame the WYZZYIRD<sup>1</sup> or the World Transfer Agency<sup>2</sup>.
(These bold souls are not often heard from again.)</p>
<p>Some suggest that the Outlands are an elaborate joke executed by
the Order of the Black Ladder<sup>3</sup>. Would that we knew the punchline.
Wouldn't that we ever see it firsthand.</p>

<h2>Uriopoges the Wiseass</h2>
<p>Few figures in the history of the Risible Republic can claim to have as much influence as <b>Urion Opogester</b>, the founder of Remigrationism. He is better known by his cultic name, <b>Uriopoges the Wiseass</b>, which he took after his violent expulsion from the Circle of Fifths and subsequent ascension as the high priest of Teramince<sup>1</sup>.</p></div>
<p>The first note of Opogester in the records of the Clamorous Convosembly is of a secretary with both exceptional eloquence and vehemence. After his election as treasurer, records in the <i>Transactions</i><sup>2</sup> indicate that he took advantage of this position to push his agenda of <i>extreme</i> slapstick and thrill pranks in the Convosembly. While Opogester had high-placed figures like Klaus DuKrampus on his side, the oppositon party headed by Undersecretary Ignatius Clivowycz<sup>3</sup> succeeded in ousting him on charges of "crimes against clownhood" and banning him from the Convosembly.</p>
<p>These seminal events would lend shape to the often-amorphous doctrines later grouped under the heading of <b>Remigrationism</b>. Preaching the ephemerality of the world and the cyclical nature of our journey through it -- the "remigration" -- Opogester, now Uriopoges, united the sectarian First Quartile around the idea that the cycle of life is a carousel, carousels are more fun if they go faster, and therefore we ought to send people around it as fast as possible.</p>
<p>Uriopoges' crowning achievement, the construction of <b>Megameat the Doomgoblet</b><sup>4</sup> [sic], was beset by resistance from orthodox and unorthodox Disquietists alike, which ultimately culminated in the Battle of Quillian Square<sup>5</sup>, where the Remigrationists were victorious despite heavy losses.</p>

<h2>War of Civil Coherence</h2>
<p>The <b>War of Civil Coherence</b> was a conflict primarily between 
hexadecisections<sup>1</sup> of the First Quartile<sup>2</sup> and everyone 
else.  It is unclear exactly why the war began, but many contemporary scholars point to 
the escalation of a wide-ranging prank war instigated by the Order of the Black Ladder<sup>3</sup> 
against the emerging Remigrationist movement.  Note that the label "War of Civil 
Coherence" is one insisted upon primarily by First Quartile scholars; among some 
Disquietist schools, it is known as "The Revolution pt. II," a reference to the 
Disquietist dogmatic teaching that all sequels are inevitably social and commercial 
failures.</p></div>
<p>The war proceeded according to the following pattern, at various scales.  First, anti-
Remigrationist forces would perform a prank or other offense in some area.  Second, First 
Quartile military forces would move to that area and attempt to stamp out resistance.  
Without the benefit of World Transfer Agency<sup>4</sup> logistical support, the resistance forces 
either fought (and died), or relocated to start the cycle anew.  </p>
<p>Resistance forces were led by General Petrov van der Deathface<sup>5</sup>, who, during the war, 
acquired a reputation as an unparalleled tactical genius.  Though unable to directly halt 
the First Quartile's advance, military historians have noted that he left them 
over-extended to the point where a handful of strategic strikes could have crippled their 
military machine.  Did the grand strategist have a plan to win the war?  Sadly, we may 
never know, as van der Deathface was killed by a stray bullet at the 
Battle of Quillian Square<sup>6</sup> while attempting to bait a squad of Kindergarten Kops<sup>7</sup> 
into charging their First Quartile allies.  Within weeks of his death, the First Quartile 
declared victory.</p>

<h2>Collected Writings and Letters of Ignatius Clivowycz</h2>
<p>The <b>Collected Writings and Letters of Ignatius Clivowycz</b> is a slim volume of content
compiled, edited, and self-published by Ignatius Clivowycz, a prominent Disquietist leader
and citizen of the First Quartile<sup>1</sup>.  Although presented as a compilation of his extant 
writings, scholars now believe that most of the documents were  written specifically for 
this publication.  For one, the flow and development of his arguments over the 
<i>Collected Writings and Letters</i> is suspiciously coherent for a collection of ostensibly 
unrelated content.  For another, most of the letters are addressed to people who do not 
actually exist.</p></div>
<p>Though undoubtedly a vanity project—it is painfully evident that Clivowycz is trying 
rather too hard to seem wise—historians have found the <i>Collected Writings and Letters</i> 
to be an invaluable historical resource, as Clivowycz's rambling banality belies numerous
pearls of insight into the political events in which he was involved.  Most notable among 
these are his description of his founding of the 
Circle of Fifths<sup>2</sup> and his eerily accurate
prediction, not only of the Genocide of the Second Quartile<sup>3</sup>, but of the specific
circumstances of his own death in the Genocide.  Various commentators, 
Petrov van der Deathface<sup>4</sup> among them, have observed that if Clivowycz knew he was going 
to die on his ill-fated trip to the Second Quartile, he could have chosen not go. Thus, 
they concluded, Clivowycz's death was probably faked to add an air of mystery to the
<i>Collected Writings and Letters</i>.</p>

<h2>Lega the Hamhanded</h2>
<p>Following the Quartile Reformation, <b>Legaria Porkins</b> saw her rise to power as the
first and current <b>elected governor of the Third Quartile</b>. If you've forgotten
that the Third Quartile even exists, that's no accident. Under Porkins'
leadership, the Third Quartile has remained absent from nearly all major Republic
conflicts.</p></div>
<p>Porkins has taken a strictly neutral stance on Remigrationism, signing nonaggression
pacts with Remigrationist leaders such as Uriopoges the Wiseass<sup>1</sup> along with resistance
leaders such as Petrov van der Deathface<sup>2</sup>. In her first address to the Republic
after these pacts, she stated the Third Quartile would not participate in the conflict
in order to devote more time and resources into foosball, the Quartile's national sport.</p>
<p>Porkins is known to participate in competitive kickboxing. Many claim she has used
fist-enlarging drugs to get an edge against her rival, the Hand of Justice<sup>3</sup> in
the ring. This conspiracy, along with an unfortunately exploitable surname,
has left her with the nickname <b>Lega the Hamhanded</b>. Her supporters deny
all allegations, but have refused to comment when questioned with the fact that
despite over 200 public broadcasts, Porkins' hands have <i>never once appeared on
camera</i>. Coincidence? Just think about it.</p>

<h2>The WYZZYIRD</h2>
<p>The <b>Wavelength Yocto-Zig-Zag Yodel Infiltration/Relocation Division</b>, or <b>WYZZYIRD</b> for short, is alleged to be a clandestine military unit operating out of the enigmatic Mystery District<sup>1</sup> in the Third Quartile. While the scant evidence of their existence (mostly notes from the private journals of Her Quartness Quartilord Lega<sup>2</sup>) is disputed academically only in hushed tones, the WYZZYIRD remains a popular topic of urban legend.</p></div>
<p>The central narratives of the WYZZYIRD legends claim that its operatives use yodelling at absurdly high frequencies -- their titular "wavelength yocto-zig-zag yodel" -- in order to quantum tunnel through walls or across great distances in order to infiltrate their target's location, where they use their yodelling to suck their target through a wormhole to the dreaded Outlands<sup>3</sup>. Some allege that the WYZZYIRD is a division of the World Transfer Agency<sup>4</sup>, but as in all things WYZZYIRD, available facts are scant.</p>
<p>One of the most popular variations on the WYZZYIRD urban legend is the claim that Joculus the Red<sup>5</sup> is one of their operatives. This tall tale is likely inspired by Joculus' boasts about his ability to hide a burrito in any fridge, even fridges unreachable to mortal men, combined with his unsettling track record of having never lied.</p>

<h2>Chloroveritase</h2>
<p><b>Chloroveritase</b> is a substance exuded by gattling ducks<sup>1</sup> during weapon discharge. Despite its humble origins as a byproduct of avian assault troops, chloroveritase has become an immensely important substance due to its curious ability to make things see-through. It sees use by the World Transfer Agency<sup>2</sup> as a screening method, which has caused some controversy given that the see-through effect sometimes does not wear off, causing transferred persons grief when their clothes or skin is made permanently transparent.</p></div>
<p>Though Petrov van der Deathface<sup>3</sup>'s eponymous condition is officially attributed by the resistance to WTA malice, no known WTA procedure applies chloroveritase only to the facial skin and muscle, and so despite the popular appeal of such stories, scholars generally consider it to have been self-inflicted for political reasons.</p>

<h2>First Quartile</h2>
<p>The <b>First Quartile</b> is one of four Quartiles that comprise the Risible Republic.  It 
enjoys a somewhat advantaged position over the other three Quartiles in Republic politics.  
Analysts attribute this mostly to force projection abilities: the World Transfer Agency<sup>1</sup>, 
based primarily in the First Quartile, has shifted significantly pro-First Quartile in 
recent years.  Due to the First Quartile's central position in the Republic, both 
geographically and politically, it has accumulated no small amount of cultural influence 
as well.  This can be seen most prominently in the recent growth of Remigrationism in 
Disquietist circles.</p></div>
<p>The national deity of the First Quartile is Teramince, Clown-God of Slaughter<sup>2</sup>.  This 
state of affairs has caused no small amount of consternation among the other Quartiles, 
particularly over such phrases in Teramince's holy book as "Go forth among the infidels 
and harvest bloodily their precious, precious organs"—a command which the First Quartile 
administration officially claims is a metaphor.  That said, some scholars have noted that 
the waitlist for organ donations is significantly shorter in the First Quartile, even 
after controlling for population and socio-economic status.  The controversy is ongoing at 
the time of writing.</p>
<p>The First Quartile boasts its share of notable personages.  These include such figures as 
spiritual leader Uriopoges the Wiseass<sup>3</sup>, noted as the founder of Remigrationism; the 
kickboxer known as the Hand of Justice<sup>4</sup>, who claims to be a prophet of Teramince; and 
Petrov van der Deathface<sup>5</sup>, despite his attempts to eradicate all traces of his past.</p>

<h2>Mystery District</h2>
<p>In every map made of the Republic, on the far side of the Third Quartile, there
is a small sector conspicuously missing. On some maps, you might see it labeled
the <b>Mystery District</b>, though this is simply a name given to the region by
fans of conspiracies surrounding it.</p></div>
<p>Due to massive walls bordering the district and an estimated 250 personnel on
patrol around the perimeter, no one from outside the district has ever been
inside. As such, absolutely nothing is known about its purpose. Conspirators
have their theories, however:</p>
<p>- As the Mystery District lies on the outer boundary of the Republic, many have
speculated ties to The Outlands<sup>1</sup>. Some believe The WYZZYIRD<sup>2</sup> is involved
in the district as well, but no one who has furthered this theory has ever
been heard from again.</p>
<p>- Perhaps a more reasonable theory is that of resistance leader
Petrov van der Deathface<sup>3</sup>, who believes the district to be the secret cult
worshipping grounds of the Clown-God of Slaughter<sup>4</sup>.</p>
<p>- Third Quartile officials have assured the public that there is nothing suspicious
going on in the district, but of course one should take these assurances with
a grain of salt.</p>
<p>Three months ago, First Quartile<sup>5</sup> leaders said they were preparing an
investigation into the Mystery District, but no action has been taken by them
since then.</p>

<h2>Teramince, Clown-God of Slaughter</h2>
<p>According to canon, Teramince ascended over the former Clown-God of Slaughter,
Gigamince, by baking him into a casserole of cosmic proportions and eating
him to gain his power. Once a year, recalling her hilarious feast, Teramince's
sanguine hunger waxes, and wanes only with a leviathan sip of the
Quadrant Cup<sup>1</sup>.</p></div>
<p>On this occasion, Teramince takes physical form from the shadows cast by the
Circus Moon<sup>2</sup> in order to walk amidst mortals and record flavor notes for
her annual people-tasting. Although unconfirmed by any written report, Uriopoges<sup>3</sup> is fabled to have become her high priest after offering her a nibble of his index finger, whereupon she pronounced him "...a man of excellent taste and flavor."</p>

<h2>Doctrine of Imbalance</h2>
<p>The <b>Doctrine of Imbalance</b> of Uriopoges the Wiseass is one of the so-called "secret doctrines" of Remigrationism. It was unknown to Remigrationism scholarship until the recent discovery that the Five-Hundred Injunctions found in the <i>Transactions</i><sup>1</sup> spell out an acrostic message. This was likely overlooked for so long because of the marginal nature of the <i>Transactions</i>. Initial reactions were highly skeptical -- the Injunctions are hurried marginal notes, after all -- but the improbability has convinced the field that the Doctrine is legitimate and inspired a search for other hidden doctrines in Uriopoges' writings.</p></div>
<p>In relation to other Remigrationist doctrines, the Doctrine of Imbalance qualifies the idea of the cycle of life to suggest that the distribution of souls in the cycle is not even, but is heavily concentrated to one side. It does not figure largely into public Remigrationist discourse, leaving the question open as to how much significance it could possibly have and raising questions about why Uriopoges went to such lengths to hide it in the <i>Transactions</i>.</p>
<p>While the tall tales of the "secret doctrines" certainly add that <i>je ne sais quoi</i> to the otherwise revolting doctrines of Remigrationism, it is in my opinion an unprofitable avenue of Remigrationist scholarship that distracts from more pressing issues, such as Rightson's<sup>2</sup> excellent recent essay on the proposals for a Reformed Remigrationism put forth by Joculus the Red<sup>3</sup> in his latest essay-length graffiti on the walls of the Mystery District<sup>4</sup>.</p>

<h2>Honorius Rightson</h2>
<p>The <b>Right Honorable Honorius Rightson, Esq., PrR, WKD</b> is a prominent scholar of 
Disquietist history and culture.  His early life was spent in the Third Quartile, but he 
soon moved to the University of Haven Rock in the First Quartile<sup>1</sup> to pursue a career in 
scholarship.  He received the degree of Practitioner of the Rock for his thesis, 
"The Implications of Grammatical Irregularities in Opogester's<sup>2</sup> 
<i>Transactions</i><sup>3</sup>."  After 
only three years of apprenticeship, he claimed the title of Wise Knower of Doctrine in 
the traditional way (that is, besting his former mentor in single combat and seizing his 
mentor's title), thereby gaining full professership.  </p></div>
<p>Rightson's scholarly work of late has focused on Remigrationism as a cultural force, 
particularly with respect to its impact on Disquietism.  Of particular note is his work 
with Jay Gubbins, the self-proclaimed prophet of 
Teramince<sup>4</sup> and self-styled Hand of Justice<sup>5</sup>.  
Although Rightson's research was able to provide valuable insight into Remigrationism, 
Gubbins's instability led him to believe that Rightson was Teramince himself.  
Because of Gubbins's influence in Remigrationist circles, it is not unusual for them to 
think Rightson is their god<sup>6</sup> in disguise, and he is often invoked in the rites 
surrounding the Quadrant Cup<sup>7</sup>.</p>
<p>In honor of the sacrifices he has made in the line of his scholarly duties, this 
Encyclopedia is dedicated to him.</p>

<h2>Petrov van der Deathface</h2>
<p>Okay, we get it. Deathface <i>allegedly</i> single-handedly wiped out no less than
twenty two Kops<sup>1</sup> in the Battle of Quillian Square<sup>2</sup>. Deathface
has a kill count greater than every other First Quartile<sup>3</sup> soldier's, combined.
We get it, Deathface was a legendary war hero. The glory of his mustache rivaled
that of Mustachius, the highest of the mustache dieties. But have you ever stopped
to think about how ridiculous those stories are? One single man, accomplishing all
Deathface did in his tragically short-lived life? It's preposterous! The man named
<b>Petrov van der Deathface</b> is nothing but a <i>sham</i>, a marketing ploy to sell
more t-shirts!</p></div>
<p>Not convinced? Then perhaps consider the fact that Deathface does not have a face.
Everyone knows that real people have faces. Therefore, Petrov van der Deathface
is not a real person. Q. E. Motherfucking. D.</p>
<p>Grab a copy of the Doctrine of Imbalance<sup>4</sup> from your local library and give it
a read. It explicitly states in there that Deathface is but a myth. Or something
similar, anyways. Point is, you've all been had! Open your eyes and don't give
into this scam!</p>

<h2>Westexico</h2>
<p>Westexico is a province on the other side of First Quartile<sup>1</sup> that serves as
God<sup>2</sup>'s burrito orchard. While it is generally respected that God<sup>3</sup>'s
burrito recipe is simply <i>divine</i>, few other sentient entities have the
sophisticated resources or knowledge necessary to construct a suitable tree to
produce them, like God<sup>4</sup> intended.</p></div>
<p>Because of the logistical problems presented by tunnelling to the other side
of the continent, burritos are a very scare resource. This scarcity makes them a
natural choice for currency in the four Quartiles, accepted anywhere in the Quartiles following the
Penultimate Compact<sup>5</sup>. Their use as currency has a few peculiar consequences -- first,
that price of a burrito is as unchanging as God<sup>6</sup> himself; and second, that one's want for
money grows proportionally with their hunger.</p>
<p>Some conjecture that The WYZZYIRD<sup>7</sup>, if it exists, is naught but a get-rich-quick scheme
with the eventual goal of exfiltrating God<sup>8</sup>'s entire Westexican Reserve, ordinarily shared
only with his elect. Similarly, there exist rumors of the Hand of Justice<sup>9</sup> plotting a
similar heist.</p>

<h2>Circus Moon</h2>
<p>In Disquietist folk tales, the "Circus Moon" heralds the arrival of Teramince<sup>1</sup> to the physical world. According to other myths, the light reflected from the moon itself is (by means curiously unspecified) sufficient to provide a form for Teramince's body. Accounts of the Circus Moon's appearance vary greatly, but commonly speak of a "stretching" or "warping", as if by a funhouse mirror. According to legend, its appearence is usually accompanied by corvids emitting the occasional "Wilhelm Scream."</p></div>
<p>Because no photographs exist of the Circus Moon and that no physical explanation has been offered for its appearance, it is clear that the Circus Moon is little more than a Disquietist fiction. Nonetheless, the tales appear to influence a great number of Disquietist traditions: even the Order of the Black Ladder<sup>2</sup> will quickly assemble for an impromptu barbequeue in the event of a supposed sighting.</p>

<h2>Hand of Justice</h2>
<p>My dear Jay,</p></div>
<p>I hope this letter finds you well as you prepare for the Thirteenth Annual Quadrant Cup<sup>1</sup> next month. Unfortunately, I must turn down your speaking request; my research is too pressing at this juncture to engage the week-long ceremonies of the Cup and prepare a lecture for the occasion.</p>
<p>I assume you have already read, or otherwise know about, my recent papers on the "secret doctrines" of Remigrationism. Though I cannot take your offer of a speaking engagement, if you have an afternoon to spare from your unending dispute with Ms Legaria<sup>2</sup>, I should be ever so greatful to discuss the recent discoveries with you. We may be much closer than anticipated to uncovering what old Urion, God<sup>3</sup> rest his soul, knew about the Genocide of the Second Quartile<sup>4</sup> prior to its occurrence. I have some theories I am eager to share about his relation to Clivowycz<sup>5</sup>.</p>
<p>Please send your response to me by letter this time. I have told you several times already: I am not Teramince<sup>6</sup>. I will not receive your response if you send it via prayer, nor will I be aware of its contents if you attach it to a carrier pigeon and toss it into a meat grinder like you did last time.</p>
<p>Your friend,</p>
<hr><span class="signature"><p> Honorious Rightson, Esq.</p></span>

<h2>The Jocular Revolution</h2>
<p>The Jocular Revolution<sup>1</sup> is the name being used for the sudden upheaval of the past 
few days.  Joculus the Red<sup>2</sup> has apparently returned, leading operatives who some claim are 
The WYZZYIRD<sup>3</sup>, to overthrow <b>Megameat the Doomgoblet</b> [sic] and restore balance to 
the Quartiles.  I've seen reports that Petrov van der Deathface<sup>4</sup> is among them.  
Uriopoges the Wiseass<sup>5</sup> has apparently been slain in combat, and 
Teramince<sup>6</sup> manifested only to be yodeled into 
The Outlands<sup>7</sup>.  Information is currently vague, hard to come by, and contradictory, but 
if even a fraction of these reports are true, the very course of history is changing as I 
pen these words.</p></div>
<p>May a brighter future await us.</p>

<h2>Trek and Remigration of the Antifestivites</h2>
<p>Among those who believe in remigrationism are the <b>Antifestivities</b>, a
less-extreme group known for their condemnation of practices encouraged by
Joculus the Red<sup>1</sup>. Although they insist that they're "nothing like those
idiots," leveraging the fact that they do not worship the
Clown-God<sup>2</sup>, they are usually lumped together
with the rest of the Disquietists.</p></div>
<p>The Antifestivities participate in the ongoing remigration, but where are they
migrating to? Some believe they are preparing to take back their homeland, a party
store in the southern parts of the First Quartile<sup>3</sup> which used to serve as their
office headquarters before the Quartile Reformation. Their name, the <i>Antifestivities</i>,
is misleading; many people mistakenly believe they are against festivities in general.
In reality, though, items such as beer, tortilla chips, and pizza delivery coupons
account for over half of what they take with them on their journeys.</p>
