<div class="contentblock"><h1>Author: Tam Everal & Ansoni of the Red Ravine</h1><p>A young tree spirit rooted within the ancient forest of the Red Ravine, Tam Everal is considered a promising scholar who is best known for his studies of transient supernatural phenomena, most of which were conducted in the first few centuries of his life. More recently, however, in a time where older spirits have began to wither away, Everal has focused on preserving the priceless and sometimes cryptic knowledge of his elders.</p>
<p>Everal observes many of the Ravine's practices, including, to the dismay of outside academics, concealing the community's arcane knowledge. Almost all of Everal's publications are superficial warnings of imminent crises. Only during the last century, with Gallowtide approaching, did Everal began revealing some of his deeper and more startling discoveries.</p>

<div class="contentblock"><p>Ansoni is the long-standing Red Ravine External Secretary, administering political and academic exchanges between the Ravine and the outside world. While her exact nature and origin is unknown, it is theorized that, because Ansoni's position requires her to interact extensively with non-Ravine individuals, the Red Ravine had carefully removed specific memories and magical abilities from Ansoni to prevent her from revealing any secret knowledge.</p>
<p>Still, Ansoni retained her intellect and political prowess, and she remains loyal to the Ravine. Yet, she often shares the curiosity of outside observers, personally advocating for a more open Ravine society. It is this unique position that recently 
convinced the Briarheart Circle to assign Ansoni the task of translating and communicating the works of Everal for the emergency council.</p>
