<p><i>-1500: The Founding of "Arcanology"</i></p>
<p><b>The Why</b></p>
<p>Nearly 3000 years ago, on the cusp of <a class="phantom" href="Gallowtide.html">Gallowtide</a> the Briarheart Circle declared a state of emergency in expectation of the historically disastrous return of new magic to the land. Given that magic systems inevitably change or are remade wholesale after the slate-clearing effects of <a  href="Hallowtide.html">Hallowtide</a>, the population of erstwhile magical practitioners had regularly dropped by over 50% as previously innocent incantations such as lighting one's cigarette with a small thumb-flame could result in summoning a greater demon. With the exception of certain 
(̶s̶o̶m̶e̶ ̶s̶a̶y̶ ̶p̶a̶r̶a̶n̶o̶i̶d̶,̶ ̶t̶h̶i̶s̶ ̶a̶u̶t̶h̶o̶r̶ ̶w̶o̶u̶l̶d̶:̶ ̶s̶a̶y̶ ̶r̶e̶a̶s̶o̶n̶a̶b̶l̶y̶ ̶p̶r̶e̶p̶a̶r̶e̶d̶)̶ magicians who may have happened to inscribe hexagrammic wards on each cigarette filter merely as a preemptory measure, many magicians perished in spectacularly gory and unpleasent ways. </p>
<p><b>Formation</b></p>
<p>In an effort to avoid such drastic fluctuations in the magical population, and the accompanying logistical nightmare of producing supply/demand curve stabilization charms on a national scale, The Briarheart Council convened a new branch of <a class="phantom" href="The_Academy.html">The Academy</a> whose primary task was to catalogue and identify new strains of magic as they emerged, cross-reference them with previous magical systems, and provide up-to-date risk analysis models in a timely manner to any magician who wished to emply prior magical systems.</p>
<p>Within the first decade of its inception, the field of Arcanology contributed to a significant decrease in accidental magical deaths(averaging ~40%), a figure that was previously unheard of within the first 300 years of a new Gallowtide and the previous process of supernatural selection that eventually resulted in a stable practitioner base.</p>
<p>Beyond the mere loss of life averted, however, the contributions to the stability of the magical commodities market resulted in significant financial gain.</p>
