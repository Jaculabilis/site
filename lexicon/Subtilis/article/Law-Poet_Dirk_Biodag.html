<div class="contentblock"><h1>Law-Poet Dirk Biodag</h1><p><b>Overview</b><br>
Law-Poet Dirk Biodag (-50–314 After Fomorian Conflict) was an aes sidhe law-poet who practiced under the Uullor court. Famous for his negotiation of “infinite circle magic” cases, Dirk Biodag’s best-known work centers on the simultaneous ambiguity and implicit contractuality of communication. In one case, <i>Gwyllion Guise vs. The Uullor Court</i>, Biodag successfully established the immateriality of intentionality in implicit magic; in particular, in banishing via knife.</p>
<p><b>Early Life</b><br>
We know Biodag was born to a pair of ironsmiths, who died in their dangerous line of work when Biodag was 8. The next reference places Biodag’s arrival at the Uullor Court in 2 AFC, as the complainants’ lawyer in the case <i>The Descendents of Teg Tyl-Wyth v. Teg Tyl-Wyth</i>, notable for establishing the citizenship rights of changelings. He rose to minor celebrity status after serving as lawyer for both plaintiff and defendant in the case <i>Alderson v. Alderson</i>. He served primarily as a civil-suits lawyer for 100 years before being appointed Court Drafter by King Finvara.</p>
<p><b>Later Career</b><br>
As Court Drafter, Biodag was responsible for drafting and editing all legislation issued from the Uullor Court, magical or otherwise. His first action was to immediately and decisively issue the <a class="phantom" href="The_Guide.html">“Standards, Styles, Spell Structures, and Most Definitive Hermeneutic Guidelines for All Legislation Hereby Issued by the Uullor Court”</a>, a document still used today (as of 1277 AFC). It is also worth considering that he considered <a class="phantom" href="The_Good_Neighbors_Law.html">the controversial Good Neighbors Law</a> his greatest achievement.</p>
<p><b>Death</b><br>
Biodag died at the old age of 364 in a freak accident while visiting the still-active iron foundry his parents perished in. His tomb is inscribed with a quote from The Guide, “There is no magic but language; no language but life; no life but magic.”</p>
