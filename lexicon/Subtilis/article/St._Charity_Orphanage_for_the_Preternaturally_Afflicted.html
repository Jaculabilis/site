<div class="contentblock"><h1>St. Charity Orphanage for the Preternaturally Afflicted</h1><p><b>St Charity's Orphanage for the Preternaturally Afflicted</b> is an orphanage dedicated by its namesake to the service of children abandoned because of preternatural afflictions, such as lycanthropy or <a class="phantom" href="Fetal_magical_syndrome.html">FMS</a>. Originally run by the Order of St Charity, it is now under the care of the Briarheart Sisters, who took over the orphanage following the extinction of the Order at the hands of <a  href="The_Lady_Disastrous.html">the Lady Disastrous</a>. While the Sisters officially run St Charity's purely as a social service, it is commonly whispered that children raised by the Sisters are briarmarked, as the orphanage boasts a disproportionate representation among those summoned by the Circle. The Circle's call is almost always for the wondrous and the unnatural, so it is no surprise that the Sisters maintain a supply line "in-house", so to speak.</p>
<p>It is worthwhile to note why it is that an institution like dear old St Charity's must exist. The truly <i>supernatural</i> is discontinuous, but the preternatural is highly tradition-bound. Even curses, when transmittable, are handed down in the context of a predecessor and successor, the one traditioning it to the other along with knowledge of its nature and behavior. Preternaturally-afflicted children usually lack this, and many parents abandon them when they cannot quickly find someone with the same affliction to take the child under their wing. Afflicted children without this tradition often face discrimination.</p>
<p>Because of the transmission vector of lycanthropy, lycanthropes are especially vulnerable to this. Even yours truly is sometimes held up from his appointments by roving Sibid ruffians looking for trouble! Even so, great strides are being made for the cause of justice. Personally, I am quite pleased that the Circle has seen fit this time to summon a council, against all odds, composed entirely of lycanthropes.</p>
