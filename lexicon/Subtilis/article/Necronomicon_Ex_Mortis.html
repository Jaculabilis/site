<p>Current Events Assignment: Necronomicon Ex Mortis</p>
<p>Necronomicon is ancient greek for, "book of the dead" (Willheart and Agony 120).  So the title translates to, "Book of the dead ex mortis".  It is named this because the book has death magic in it, which can be used to do evil (Torment 12-21) (Blight 157).  </p>
<p>The Necronomicon was found in the <a class="phantom" href="Fell_Corruption.html">Fell Corruption</a> where it was discovered by John Tyrant III (Tyrant 14).  Who had a name so good they had to use it three times.  He wrote, that it was inked in human blood and written on human skins (Tyrant 26).  The fell rituals are believed to have generated the fall of the <a class="phantom" href="Arcadian_Empire.html">Arcadian Empire</a> and how it was swallowed up by the Choked Wood.  </p>
<p>Now the Necronomicon resides under the control of the Briarheart Circle, though many rumors which haven't been proven say that it has gone missing (Fetterley 688).  As a citizen of the world everyone has a duty to pay attention to said events.  </p>
