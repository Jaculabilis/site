<div class="contentblock"><h1>Moorland</h1><p><b>Overview</b><br>
<b>Moorland</b> is a bog characterized by low ph value, thick layers of peat, and dense concentrations of long-burning magic. Although their exact ecological origin is still unknown, theories range from ancient civilizations to environmental factors and local fauna[1]. Moorland is particularly affected by the shifts in season between <a class="phantom" href="Gallowtide.html">Gallowtide</a> and <a  href="Hallowtide.html">Hallowtide</a>, frequently being crusaded during seasons of the latter (but almost as quickly abandoned).[2]</p>
<p><b>Ecosystem</b><br>
The moorland is subject to unique ecosystems, not only to account for the density of magic and acid, but also the corresponding lack of divine presence. Heather, a well-known magic fixator, thrives in these area. Adders and short-eared owls, creatures many speculate to be <a  href="Diabology.html">diabological</a>, feed on water-rats and toads, either of which may attempt to defend themselves with simple spells. </p>
<p><b>Cultures</b><br>
The Moorlander culture is among the most distinctive in all the world. No doubt, this is due to the presence of potent ingredients, such as juniper, cranberry, cottongrass, heather, and rosemary, leading to a thriving trade of textiles and cuisine. Although people of all races live there, dryads, selkies, gwyllion, and aes sidhe are particularly concentrated.[3] Moorlanders also pride themselves in their expansive funeral arrangements, leading to the highest concentration of mummies, banshees, will o' wisps, and ghosts almost anywhere.[4]</p>
