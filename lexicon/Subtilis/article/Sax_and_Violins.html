<p>Sax and Violins</p>
<p>Sax and Violins is a thrash metal band that's been banned by most good establishments such as this school because they are responsible for <a  href="Cascade_Illness.html">everything</a> <a class="phantom" href="Fetal_magical_syndrome.html">that</a> <a  href="The_Trash_Disaster3A_Who_to_Blame.html">is</a> <a  href="Withering_Memory.html">wrong</a> <a  href="Great_Rupture.html">in the world</a>.  But lots of people especially teenage boys but not me still listen to them because their lead violinist is smokin hawt.  </p>
<hr><span class="signature"><p></p></span>
<p><b>Members</b></p>
<p>The band is fronted by Suzi Succubus, vocalist.  The lead violinist is Sassy Sclerosis.  Krazy Kage is on drums, Yugn'wot'vaaath is saxophone, and HIS NAME IS A KILLING WORD is the bass violin.  </p>
<p>All band members are <a  href="Diabology.html">demons</a>, they met in Hell No. 5.5 of 7.  This is why they are responsible for the corruption of our youth.  At their <a  href="Great_Rupture.html">last concert</a> there was an orgy-murder-suicide which was metal as shit.  </p>
<hr><span class="signature"><p></p></span>
<p><b>Current Projects</b></p>
<p>Right now their focus according to HIS NAME IS A KILLING WORD is probably bouncing around their fans and worshippers, experimenting with new melodies, and deathfucking their groupies.  But we can't be sure because all interviews with HIS NAME kill the interviewer through blood from the ears and also mess with the recording over time.  </p>
