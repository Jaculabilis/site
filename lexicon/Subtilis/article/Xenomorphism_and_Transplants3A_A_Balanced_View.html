<div class="contentblock"><h1>Xenomorphism and Transplants: A Balanced View</h1><p>While Vexis Reagh maintains that there is absolutely no reason to fear contracting lycanthropy through the transplantation of brains or other internal organs, <a class="phantom" href="Sibid_ruffians.html">Sibid ruffians</a> have made it pretty much impossible to run the out-patient clinic of the Ann Arbor Holistic Center for Brain Transplantation and Wellness near the Briarwood Mall, except during the day, since they assume that even a little kidney would turn its new owner into a hairy monster that eats all Teg Tyl-Wyth at night.</p>
<p>The truth, as always, lies somewhere in between the extremists.  While it is true that techniques that screen for lycanthropic origin of organs have improved greatly since donation became universally mandatory, they are still far from perfect.  That being said, the dangers of such organs are greatly exaggerated.  Double blind clinical trials led by a team under Dr. Ithloday of the A2HCBTW and Dr. McGill of the <a class="phantom" href="Fomorian_Brain_and_Ophthalmic_Research_Lab.html">Fomorian Brain and Ophthalmic Research Lab</a> have shown that recipients of an L-brain merely have wolfish dreams at the time of the full moon which intensify to waking hallucinations or wane completely depending on the <a  href="Hallowtide.html">tides</a>.  Those with an L-liver have an insatiable hunger for raw meat on the same cycle and those with a were-wolfâ€™s heart feel a mystical calling to run around and howl at the moon, nothing more.  In patients with all three lycanthropic organs, some additional growth of hair, teeth and nails was observable at these times although they can be largely prevented by a diet rich in cucumbers.  (Funding was insufficient to test other organs or combinations thereof.)  Therefore some care is urged in the case of repeat replacement.  </p>
<p>As with all else in life, it is necessary to weigh the risks and rewards of a new heart, brain or liver.</p>
