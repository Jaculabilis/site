<p>Honored scholars,</p>
<p>I thank you for accepting the summons willingly. Though the Circle&#39;s will is incontrovertible, it is meet and right that those it calls should cooperate of their own free choice. Today is a bless√®d day, for today we undertake the sacred task of composing the Lexicon Subtilis&mdash;a document that shall be a guide for all the fair folk through this heavy time.</p>

<p>Honored scholars,</p>
<p>As the appointed Editor for the Lexicon Subtilis, I thank you for submitting your short-form biographies. I have collected and submitted them to the Circle for consideration, and they have now been posted.</p>
<p>Regarding the first round of articles, two of our fellow scholars have some other business requiring their attention for the moment, and they may not be able to submit their articles until the weekend. I beg your patience on this matter, in the hope that the diversity of our peers will make up for the additional complications of coordinating this many academics.</p>
