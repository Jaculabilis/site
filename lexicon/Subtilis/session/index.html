<p>Honored scholars,</p>
<p>I thank you for accepting the summons willingly. Though the Circle&#39;s will is incontrovertible, it is meet and right that those it calls should cooperate of their own free choice. Today is a bless√®d day, for today we undertake the sacred task of composing the Lexicon Subtilis&mdash;a document that shall be a guide for all the fair folk through this heavy time.</p>

<p>Honored scholars,</p>
<p>As the appointed Editor for the Lexicon Subtilis, I thank you for submitting your short-form biographies. I have collected and submitted them to the Circle for consideration, and they have now been posted.</p>
<p>Regarding the first round of articles, two of our fellow scholars have some other business requiring their attention for the moment, and they may not be able to submit their articles until the weekend. I beg your patience on this matter, in the hope that the diversity of our peers will make up for the additional complications of coordinating this many academics.</p>

<p>Honored scholars,</p>
<p>Wow! I let some paperwork pile up, and before I knew it, I was trapped inside my office for four days! I suppose this is an object lesson in why we have secretaries. I didn't dig mine out of the last paper avalanche and it's really hurting my productivity.</p>
<p>That aside, if you haven't, do take a look at the first round of articles for the Lexicon. If you already have, take another look, as I was finally able to get Ansoni's article on Cascade Illness posted. Dreadful stuff! The subject, not the article.</p>
<p>You've all received your next index assignments already, as I understand, so please send those to me over the weekend if possible. The Circle will give me more paperwork if I don't have the material collected by <b>Monday the 24th</b>.</p>
