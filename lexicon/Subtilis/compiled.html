<p><i>-1500: The Founding of "Arcanology"</i></p>
<p><b>The Why</b></p>
<p>Nearly 3000 years ago, on the cusp of <u>Gallowtide</u><sup>2</sup> the Briarheart Circle declared a state of emergency in expectation of the historically disastrous return of new magic to the land. Given that magic systems inevitably change or are remade wholesale after the slate-clearing effects of <u>Hallowtide</u><sup>3</sup>, the population of erstwhile magical practitioners had regularly dropped by over 50% as previously innocent incantations such as lighting one's cigarette with a small thumb-flame could result in summoning a greater demon. With the exception of certain 
(̶s̶o̶m̶e̶ ̶s̶a̶y̶ ̶p̶a̶r̶a̶n̶o̶i̶d̶,̶ ̶t̶h̶i̶s̶ ̶a̶u̶t̶h̶o̶r̶ ̶w̶o̶u̶l̶d̶:̶ ̶s̶a̶y̶ ̶r̶e̶a̶s̶o̶n̶a̶b̶l̶y̶ ̶p̶r̶e̶p̶a̶r̶e̶d̶)̶ magicians who may have happened to inscribe hexagrammic wards on each cigarette filter merely as a preemptory measure, many magicians perished in spectacularly gory and unpleasent ways. </p>
<p><b>Formation</b></p>
<p>In an effort to avoid such drastic fluctuations in the magical population, and the accompanying logistical nightmare of producing supply/demand curve stabilization charms on a national scale, The Briarheart Council convened a new branch of <u>The Academy</u><sup>4</sup> whose primary task was to catalogue and identify new strains of magic as they emerged, cross-reference them with previous magical systems, and provide up-to-date risk analysis models in a timely manner to any magician who wished to emply prior magical systems.</p>
<p>Within the first decade of its inception, the field of Arcanology contributed to a significant decrease in accidental magical deaths(averaging ~40%), a figure that was previously unheard of within the first 300 years of a new Gallowtide and the previous process of supernatural selection that eventually resulted in a stable practitioner base.</p>
<p>Beyond the mere loss of life averted, however, the contributions to the stability of the magical commodities market resulted in significant financial gain.</p>

<p>Still, Ansoni retained her intellect and political prowess, and she remains loyal to the Ravine. Yet, she often shares the curiosity of outside observers, personally advocating for a more open Ravine society. It is this unique position that recently

<p></p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>Cascade Illness</h2><p><b>Cascade Illness</b>, vernacularly known as  "shattering", is a supernatural medical condition in which a spirit entity is gradually divided into semi-dependent, dysfunctional fragments over the course of a few decades. Although only common among elderly spirits (&gt;10,000 years old), disruptions on the astral plane could significantly increase the frequency of the illness. Most famously, at the <u>Siege of Cornaperal</u><sup>1</sup>, the weaponry used is believed to have induced the illness in thousands.</p></div>
<p><br>
<i>Symptoms</i></p>
<p>The illness begins with the spirit's aura pulsing at a steadily increasing rate and magnitude. The alignment and integrity of the spirit becomes unstable, until the spirit splits at the peak of one of the pulses. The process then repeats for the new entities, creating a "cascade" of disorderly dividing. </p>
<p>Each split divides the spirit's mental and magical components into separate fragments in a seemingly random manner. For example, a fragment may retain an ability to decipher written language, while the other fragments struggle to understand basic grammar. Memories and magical abilities are often split in a similar fashion. </p>
<p>Initially, the fragments are able to communicate via a shared stream of consciousness, but as the number of fragments grows, the increased complexity of coordination critically degrades the spirit's flow of thought. Eventually, the mind is dissolved into noise, and the aura is dissipated into the astral plane.</p>
<p><br>
<i>Causes</i></p>
<p>Studies conducted across ancient communities found a correlation between Cascade Illness and exposure to "background noise" on the astral plane - hence, older spirits are affected the most. In particular, the studies suggest that the illness is caused by interference from specific astral frequencies, amplified by mystic crises such as the <u>Great Rupture</u><sup>2</sup> and <u>Gallowtide</u><sup>3</sup> events.</p>
<p><br>
<i>Treatments</i></p>
<p>Attempts to prevent, mitigate, or cure the illness have been unsuccessful. The long-standing effects of the Great Rupture are practically unavoidable, and any magical countermeasure usually worsens the illness with its own astral frequencies.</p>
<p>However, there have been three recently recorded cases where the illness stopped without external influence. The partial cascading leaves the spirits in a confused limbo between stability and insanity. Recent efforts to find treatments have focused on reproducing these cases.</p>

While one could go on (and indeed, many diabologians and theologians have) about the various arguments for superiority of deities each religion gives, or of the various gods, demigods, and semidemigods that have contested with each other for followers, it is important to take a step back and investigate two distinct and important issues.</p></div>
<p>1) Why are these religions so numerous, and why can they not get along?</p>
<p>2) What, if anything, constitutes an antithesis to the many religions?</p>
<p>It is in these two questions that diabology is most interested. However, one must note it is of considerable difficulty to study such lofty questions when <u>the Academy</u><sup>1</sup> is continually in a state of civil war between theologians, diabologians, <u>arcanologists</u><sup>2</sup>, and staff members attempting to justify their existence.

<p>The resources diabology provides scholars with are vast, but even they are stretched thin when studying the far reaching implications of the greatest metaphysical disaster the Land has ever known. In this paper I will forego any attempts to describe what exactly caused it (exempting a preliminary discussion on the use of an accented e in the word Blessed and how that began this whole sad state of affairs), and instead focus on the religious aspects, which are as numerous as they are conflicting.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The gods and demigods* that came from this disaster fought each other zealously for their very existence, as it is clear that reality can only contain so much divinity. When reality was shattered, the Land became the most hotly contested of all <u>nine planes of reality</u><sup>1</sup>.** Scholars have hotly debated why the Land has been so fiercely fought over, but it is obvious that it is the intersection of the strong presence of arcanology, giving them followers not only willing to give them due oblation, but also warriors capable of dealing actual harm to their celestial rivals.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Needless to say quite a few deities found their champions in superior mortals (we all have experience the horrors of <u>The Lady Disastrous</u><sup>2</sup>, who attempted to bring the Briarhart Circle under her dread grasp and was indeed only repelled by our knowledge of even <u>fouler magicks</u><sup>3</sup>*** than hers).</p>
<p>*Semidemigods did not spawn until at least 101 lunar cycles after the Great Rupture, some scholars argue for longer, on the order of 500, though none convincingly.</p>
<p>**Ohio being the only plane of reality over which none of the divine beings, not even the semidemigods, wished to contest, for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>***Indeed, fellow scholars, lycanthropes, students, and others, we will pay dearly for our crimes against reality.</p>

It is true that the two forces are <i>incompatible</i>, but it is not an opposition.  Rather, both are subject to ontological "seasons," if you will, that cause their influence on our reality to wax and wane.  At the tipping point where magical forces of various natures win out over the power of the gods, there is a periodic event known as <u>Gallowtide</u><sup>2</sup>.  At the other end of the pendulum, where magic dwindles and the gods rise once more, we celebrate <b>Hallowtide</b>.</p></div>
<p>The rites and customs surrounding Hallowtide could easily fill their own Lexicon, but a few common threads tie them together.  The most obvious of these threads is the pervasive air of festivity, as a decline in magical power means the Courts will cause much less collateral damage in their conflict.  At the same time, the festival carries a slight twinge of guilt, as the arrival of Hallowtide means that the gods can once again smite us for impiety.  The Land loses many of its bolder comedians around this time.</p>
<p>Each polity retains its own, idiomatic practices concerning Hallowtide.  That said, it is common for families to engage in gift-giving when the day arrives.  It is theorized by anthropologists that this is descended from an older practice whereby magicians would trade around their now-worthless magical artifacts in hopes of finding something that would still function in the mana drought that accompanies Hallowtide, if not prove useful when magic returned to the Land.  The practice has died out ever since magicians discovered that the magic systems that return at Gallowtide are usually different than the ones that left at Hallowtide, rendering their artifacts &mdash; in all probability &mdash; completely useless.</p>

In this she is second to <u>the Lord of Rivers' Wrath</u><sup>1</sup>, and of the other we do not speak.  Unlike her peers, however, scholarly consensus holds the damage attributed to the Lady Disastrous was largely accidental.  It bears acknowledging that her Ladyship is a title of convenience: neither Court has ever bestowed lordship of disastrousness.  Indeed, the Lady Disastrous holds the historical distinction of claiming <i>neither</i> Court as a patron, as their simultaneous plotting to get her enrolled with the other Court left her completely adrift.</p></div>
<p>The Lady Disastrous was born Emile Vanislav in a mid-Hallows period.  Inducted into the Order of St. Charity at a young age, she swiftly rose through the ranks due to an unnatural series of accidents befalling those around her.  In many similar cases, such accidents would seem to be the result of malicious design, but young Vanislav was apparently both earnest and unable to control many of the damning factors that doomed her schemes.  For example, her elevation to Abbot was preceded by a deadly fire caused by a phlogiston muffin bake sale inside an Abbey made of lesser darkwood&mdash;although the reaction is known to us now, researchers would not discover it for another hundred moons after her time.</p>
<p>The historical record tells us of a career marked by increasingly ambitious attempts to do good marked by disproportionate backlashes.  These catastrophic attempts at charity often involved large-scale divine blessings gone unimaingably awry: one recalls, for example, that the Targeld region attained its contemporary status after a blessing to calm the native wildlife instead converted the populace into the first recorded lycanthropes.  And it hardly bears mentioning that, to this very day, worshippers must contend with the <u>fallout</u><sup>2</sup> of the time she blessed the <u>Necronomicon Ex Mortis</u><sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p>The Order of St. Charity collapsed after the Lady Disastrous attempted to do their accounting <i>pro bono</i>.  Penniless and in disgrace, the Lady Disastrous died in 732 AFC attempting to give herself a haircut.</p>

Law-Poet Dirk Biodag (-50–314 After Fomorian Conflict) was an aes sidhe law-poet who practiced under the Uullor court. Famous for his negotiation of “infinite circle magic” cases, Dirk Biodag’s best-known work centers on the simultaneous ambiguity and implicit contractuality of communication. In one case, <i>Gwyllion Guise vs. The Uullor Court</i>, Biodag successfully established the immateriality of intentionality in implicit magic; in particular, in banishing via knife.</p></div>
<p><b>Early Life</b><br>
We know Biodag was born to a pair of ironsmiths, who died in their dangerous line of work when Biodag was 8. The next reference places Biodag’s arrival at the Uullor Court in 2 AFC, as the complainants’ lawyer in the case <i>The Descendents of Teg Tyl-Wyth v. Teg Tyl-Wyth</i>, notable for establishing the citizenship rights of changelings. He rose to minor celebrity status after serving as lawyer for both plaintiff and defendant in the case <i>Alderson v. Alderson</i>. He served primarily as a civil-suits lawyer for 100 years before being appointed Court Drafter by King Finvara.</p>
<p><b>Later Career</b><br>
As Court Drafter, Biodag was responsible for drafting and editing all legislation issued from the Uullor Court, magical or otherwise. His first action was to immediately and decisively issue the <u>“Standards, Styles, Spell Structures, and Most Definitive Hermeneutic Guidelines for All Legislation Hereby Issued by the Uullor Court”</u><sup>1</sup>, a document still used today (as of 1277 AFC). It is also worth considering that he considered <u>the controversial Good Neighbors Law</u><sup>2</sup> his greatest achievement.</p>
<p><b>Death</b><br>
Biodag died at the old age of 364 in a freak accident while visiting the still-active iron foundry his parents perished in. His tomb is inscribed with a quote from The Guide, “There is no magic but language; no language but life; no life but magic.”</p>

<b>Moorland</b> is a bog characterized by low ph value, thick layers of peat, and dense concentrations of long-burning magic. Although their exact ecological origin is still unknown, theories range from ancient civilizations to environmental factors and local fauna[1]. Moorland is particularly affected by the shifts in season between <u>Gallowtide</u><sup>1</sup> and <u>Hallowtide</u><sup>2</sup>, frequently being crusaded during seasons of the latter (but almost as quickly abandoned).[2]</p></div>
<p><b>Ecosystem</b><br>
The moorland is subject to unique ecosystems, not only to account for the density of magic and acid, but also the corresponding lack of divine presence. Heather, a well-known magic fixator, thrives in these area. Adders and short-eared owls, creatures many speculate to be <u>diabological</u><sup>3</sup>, feed on water-rats and toads, either of which may attempt to defend themselves with simple spells. </p>
<p><b>Cultures</b><br>
The Moorlander culture is among the most distinctive in all the world. No doubt, this is due to the presence of potent ingredients, such as juniper, cranberry, cottongrass, heather, and rosemary, leading to a thriving trade of textiles and cuisine. Although people of all races live there, dryads, selkies, gwyllion, and aes sidhe are particularly concentrated.[3] Moorlanders also pride themselves in their expansive funeral arrangements, leading to the highest concentration of mummies, banshees, will o' wisps, and ghosts almost anywhere.[4]</p>

<p>Current Events Assignment: Necronomicon Ex Mortis</p>
<p>Necronomicon is ancient greek for, "book of the dead" (Willheart and Agony 120).  So the title translates to, "Book of the dead ex mortis".  It is named this because the book has death magic in it, which can be used to do evil (Torment 12-21) (Blight 157).  </p>
<p>The Necronomicon was found in the <u>Fell Corruption</u><sup>1</sup> where it was discovered by John Tyrant III (Tyrant 14).  Who had a name so good they had to use it three times.  He wrote, that it was inked in human blood and written on human skins (Tyrant 26).  The fell rituals are believed to have generated the fall of the <u>Arcadian Empire</u><sup>2</sup> and how it was swallowed up by the Choked Wood.  </p>
<p>Now the Necronomicon resides under the control of the Briarheart Circle, though many rumors which haven't been proven say that it has gone missing (Fetterley 688).  As a citizen of the world everyone has a duty to pay attention to said events.  </p>

<p>All band members are <u>demons</u><sup>6</sup>, they met in Hell No. 5.5 of 7.  This is why they are responsible for the corruption of our youth.  At their <u>last concert</u><sup>7</sup> there was an orgy-murder-suicide which was metal as shit.  </p>

<p><b>Current Projects</b></p>
<p>Right now their focus according to HIS NAME IS A KILLING WORD is probably bouncing around their fans and worshippers, experimenting with new melodies, and deathfucking their groupies.  But we can't be sure because all interviews with HIS NAME kill the interviewer through blood from the ears and also mess with the recording over time.  </p>

Originally run by the Order of St Charity, it is now under the care of the Briarheart Sisters, who took over the orphanage following the extinction of the Order at the hands of <u>the Lady Disastrous</u><sup>2</sup>. While the Sisters officially run St Charity's purely as a social service, it is commonly whispered that children raised by the Sisters are briarmarked, as the orphanage boasts a disproportionate representation among those summoned by the Circle. The Circle's call is almost always for the wondrous and the unnatural, so it is no surprise that the Sisters maintain a supply line "in-house", so to speak.</p></div>
<p>It is worthwhile to note why it is that an institution like dear old St Charity's must exist. The truly <i>supernatural</i> is discontinuous, but the preternatural is highly tradition-bound. Even curses, when transmittable, are handed down in the context of a predecessor and successor, the one traditioning it to the other along with knowledge of its nature and behavior. Preternaturally-afflicted children usually lack this, and many parents abandon them when they cannot quickly find someone with the same affliction to take the child under their wing. Afflicted children without this tradition often face discrimination.</p>
<p>Because of the transmission vector of lycanthropy, lycanthropes are especially vulnerable to this. Even yours truly is sometimes held up from his appointments by roving Sibid ruffians looking for trouble! Even so, great strides are being made for the cause of justice. Personally, I am quite pleased that the Circle has seen fit this time to summon a council, against all odds, composed entirely of lycanthropes.</p>

The Lady Disastrous</p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>Tentacle-Induced Prayer Disruption</h2><p><i>This entry hasn't been written yet.</i></p></div><p></p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>The Trash Disaster: Who to Blame</h2><p>Dr. Uriel Ithloday, freely and under no compulsion, admits to criminal negligence, lack of foresight and medically necessitated inebriation that prevented him from noticing that his patients were about to bury the known world under 3 meters of toxically enchanted trash. The
warning signs were present in the very first file involving Mr. Baker who has since been vindicated of responsibility for his actions:</p></div>
<p><i>Subject: Cliff Baker</i><br>
<i>Occupation: Garbage Collector</i><br>
<i>Reason for Transplant: Severe Head Trauma due to auto accident</i><br>
<i>Donor: Dr. Felding, Historian at the University, Member of the Grove of the
Shining Lake and the Druidic Assembly of the Oak and Boar</i>.<br>
<i>Cause of donation: Congestive Heart Failure.</i></p>
<p><i>Notes:</i><br>
<i>Mr. Baker complains that his new brain keeps spouting random facts about History
which is a subject that he never liked.  Worse, it turns out that <u>Dr. Felding</u><sup>1</sup>
was a secret fan of Ohio State football, which sits ill upon Mr. Baker’s heart and
liver.  It keeps going on and on about how “that land” (Toledo Ohio) came into this
state , besides bringing in odd observations about Alsace Lorraine and how France
ultimately won because of the fays which makes Mr. Baker feel rather uncomfortable
since he does not believe in fairies and wishes he would stop seeing them during his
rounds.</i>
<i>Suggested Treatment: Since Mr. Baker’s post operation humoral disposition has
become cold and moist: 2 glasses of a dry and heating wine such as Cabernet
Sauvignon per diem and 1 session of <u>cognitive football therapy</u><sup>2</sup> per week.</i></p>
<p>This disastrous prescription (Mr. Baker weighed 120 lb’s and took his wine first
thing in the morning) led to a vicious spiral of auto-accidents, delayed trash
pickup, riots in the stadium, increased head-injuries and hence transplants, larger
numbers of patients for Dr. Ithloday, more bungled prescriptions and so on, leading
to the situation we have now.</p>

Mortals dwell on the Earth (or, as the Sibid call it, the Earth) and fae dwell in the Land. In the course of their eternal Dance, they often touch. Parts of the Land become interwoven with parts of the Earth, creating a liminal space through which one may pass from one world to another. The ludic tempo of the Dance ensures that the fae are never lacking for Weave regions through which to pass in and out of the mortal realm.</p></div>
<p>The <b>Unweaving</b> is a feared collapse of this play between Land and Earth. Whispers of the end of the Dance began circulating among Circle-adjacent scholars after the <u>Jack of Binding</u><sup>1</sup> entered a Weave region and bound Land and Earth together. After eight days of strain, <u>the Land tore</u><sup>2</sup>. Some parts of the Weave region merged wholly with the Earth, others disintegrated into unintelligibility, and the rest of the Land broke away to continue the Dance. It is feared that this wound may fester, unraveling the Land until all of it has either collapsed into the categories of mortal existence or spun off from the Dance into oblivion. The Weave would end, and with it the Dance.</p>
<p>Speculation blames the Jack of Accounting, whose thorough inventory of the Weave region prevented the Land from weaving out. We fae are, after all, liminal things in our own way, creatures of the known unknown, like ice that melts under the direct light of observation. To be cataloged, to be fit into a theory, <i>dissected</i>&mdash;is this not to cease to be fae? This, then, is the paradox of the Unweaving: that precisely in becoming known, we will be <u>forgotten</u><sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p>The threat of the Unweaving has led to some fae attempting increasingly ludicrous stunts to bamboozle the mortal world, including, but not limited to, <u>covering the Earth in magic garbage</u><sup>4</sup>. Though interference of this level is normally forbidden, in light of circumstances, the criminal penalties have been suspended.</p>

The Trash Disaster: Who to Blame</p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>What Lurks Beneath the Swamp</h2><p><i>This entry hasn't been written yet.</i></p></div><p></p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>Withering Memory</h2><p>According to several scholars in the Sibid Court, at the last full-moon many recieved a vision of a spiderweb suspended between two dreams. One was of rage, the other nameless loss.<br>
This sign certainly indicates the evidence of what many have feared: that The Land is being forgotten. </p></div>
<p>A certain scholar, having laboured this past week between the rising and the setting of the moon, conversing on occasion with the others of the Sibid Court~though they dwell in the hollows of the night, and Ullor Court rules the day, they are not as some suggest, "creatures of darkness," but even so love the beauty of the evening sky~discovered that the startling rouge of a small child's first glimpse of sunset, which he had been intending to dissect, had vanished.<br>
It had been placed in a container of starlight, as is done, but upon the next evening, the starlight held nothing but a salt rime like dried tears. <br>
Given the well-known preservative nature of woven starlight, this event has produced tremors in the Sibid Court and one must assume, despite their deep-seated omphaloskepsis,the Ullor Court as well, indicating an essential instability in the very fabric of The Land. Certain other signs, an arrangement of false stars in the shape of an empty cup, the Great Yew being late to flower, and other such occurrences have given rise to a certainty in the minds of many that the <u>Unweaving</u><sup>1</sup>, long feared, often ridiculed, may now be coming about. 
Although it many consider it unthinkable and indeed anathema, it is the opinion of some that the only solution left may be to breach the <u>First Contract</u><sup>2</sup>.<br>
It seems possible that the world of Man has ceased to remember the People, whether by story, or by heart, and with it, the People themselves may fade. It is imperative that all scholars, be they of either Court, take action by further study.</p>

<p>1. Unweaving<br>2. First Contract</p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>Xenomorphism and Transplants: A Balanced View</h2><p>While Vexis Reagh maintains that there is absolutely no reason to fear contracting lycanthropy through the transplantation of brains or other internal organs, <u>Sibid ruffians</u><sup>1</sup> have made it pretty much impossible to run the out-patient clinic of the Ann Arbor Holistic Center for Brain Transplantation and Wellness near the Briarwood Mall, except during the day, since they assume that even a little kidney would turn its new owner into a hairy monster that eats all Teg Tyl-Wyth at night.</p></div>
<p>The truth, as always, lies somewhere in between the extremists.  While it is true that techniques that screen for lycanthropic origin of organs have improved greatly since donation became universally mandatory, they are still far from perfect.  That being said, the dangers of such organs are greatly exaggerated.  Double blind clinical trials led by a team under Dr. Ithloday of the A2HCBTW and Dr. McGill of the <u>Fomorian Brain and Ophthalmic Research Lab</u><sup>2</sup> have shown that recipients of an L-brain merely have wolfish dreams at the time of the full moon which intensify to waking hallucinations or wane completely depending on the <u>tides</u><sup>3</sup>.  Those with an L-liver have an insatiable hunger for raw meat on the same cycle and those with a were-wolf’s heart feel a mystical calling to run around and howl at the moon, nothing more.  In patients with all three lycanthropic organs, some additional growth of hair, teeth and nails was observable at these times although they can be largely prevented by a diet rich in cucumbers.  (Funding was insufficient to test other organs or combinations thereof.)  Therefore some care is urged in the case of repeat replacement.  </p>
<p>As with all else in life, it is necessary to weigh the risks and rewards of a new heart, brain or liver.</p>
