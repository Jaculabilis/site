More recently, however, in a time where older spirits have began to wither away, Everal has focused on preserving the priceless and sometimes cryptic knowledge of his elders.</p></div>
<p>Everal observes many of the Ravine's practices, including, to the dismay of outside academics, concealing the community's arcane knowledge. Almost all of Everal's publications are superficial warnings of imminent crises. Only during the last century, with Gallowtide approaching, did Everal began revealing some of his deeper and more startling discoveries.</p>
<p></p><p>Ansoni is the long-standing Red Ravine External Secretary, administering political and academic exchanges between the Ravine and the outside world. While her exact nature and origin is unknown, it is theorized that, because Ansoni's position requires her to interact extensively with non-Ravine individuals, the Red Ravine had carefully removed specific memories and magical abilities from Ansoni to prevent her from revealing any secret knowledge.</p>
<p>Still, Ansoni retained her intellect and political prowess, and she remains loyal to the Ravine. Yet, she often shares the curiosity of outside observers, personally advocating for a more open Ravine society. It is this unique position that recently 
convinced the Briarheart Circle to assign Ansoni the task of translating and communicating the works of Everal for the emergency council.</p>

His most well-known research projects are archaeological investigations of the traditions of the Land, the preservation of which he claims is the most important calling a scholar can have. Despite the abundance of lecture invitations he accepts, it is difficult to hear him speak in person, as due to his abnormally bad luck he is usually waylaid by some disaster on the way to the event. Outside of his academic work, he is a fervent supporter of lycanthropic rights.</p></div>
<p></p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>Cascade Illness</h2><p><b>Cascade Illness</b>, vernacularly known as  "shattering", is a supernatural medical condition in which a spirit entity is gradually divided into semi-dependent, dysfunctional fragments over the course of a few decades. Although only common among elderly spirits (&gt;10,000 years old), disruptions on the astral plane could significantly increase the frequency of the illness. Most famously, at the <u>Siege of Cornaperal</u><sup>1</sup>, the weaponry used is believed to have induced the illness in thousands.</p></div>
<p><br>
<i>Symptoms</i></p>
<p>The illness begins with the spirit's aura pulsing at a steadily increasing rate and magnitude. The alignment and integrity of the spirit becomes unstable, until the spirit splits at the peak of one of the pulses. The process then repeats for the new entities, creating a "cascade" of disorderly dividing. </p>
<p>Each split divides the spirit's mental and magical components into separate fragments in a seemingly random manner. For example, a fragment may retain an ability to decipher written language, while the other fragments struggle to understand basic grammar. Memories and magical abilities are often split in a similar fashion. </p>
<p>Initially, the fragments are able to communicate via a shared stream of consciousness, but as the number of fragments grows, the increased complexity of coordination critically degrades the spirit's flow of thought. Eventually, the mind is dissolved into noise, and the aura is dissipated into the astral plane.</p>
<p><br>
<i>Causes</i></p>
<p>Studies conducted across ancient communities found a correlation between Cascade Illness and exposure to "background noise" on the astral plane - hence, older spirits are affected the most. In particular, the studies suggest that the illness is caused by interference from specific astral frequencies, amplified by mystic crises such as the <u>Great Rupture</u><sup>2</sup> and <u>Gallowtide</u><sup>3</sup> events.</p>
<p><br>
<i>Treatments</i></p>
<p>Attempts to prevent, mitigate, or cure the illness have been unsuccessful. The long-standing effects of the Great Rupture are practically unavoidable, and any magical countermeasure usually worsens the illness with its own astral frequencies.</p>
<p>However, there have been three recently recorded cases where the illness stopped without external influence. The partial cascading leaves the spirits in a confused limbo between stability and insanity. Recent efforts to find treatments have focused on reproducing these cases.</p>

While one could go on (and indeed, many diabologians and theologians have) about the various arguments for superiority of deities each religion gives, or of the various gods, demigods, and semidemigods that have contested with each other for followers, it is important to take a step back and investigate two distinct and important issues.</p></div>
<p>1) Why are these religions so numerous, and why can they not get along?</p>
<p>2) What, if anything, constitutes an antithesis to the many religions?</p>
<p>It is in these two questions that diabology is most interested. However, one must note it is of considerable difficulty to study such lofty questions when <u>the Academy</u><sup>1</sup> is continually in a state of civil war between theologians, diabologians, <u>arcanologists</u><sup>2</sup>, and staff members attempting to justify their existence. Alas, such is the cost of the forward progress of academia.</p>

It is true that the two forces are <i>incompatible</i>, but it is not an opposition.  Rather, both are subject to ontological "seasons," if you will, that cause their influence on our reality to wax and wane.  At the tipping point where magical forces of various natures win out over the power of the gods, there is a periodic event known as <u>Gallowtide</u><sup>2</sup>.  At the other end of the pendulum, where magic dwindles and the gods rise once more, we celebrate <b>Hallowtide</b>.</p></div>
<p>The rites and customs surrounding Hallowtide could easily fill their own Lexicon, but a few common threads tie them together.  The most obvious of these threads is the pervasive air of festivity, as a decline in magical power means the Courts will cause much less collateral damage in their conflict.  At the same time, the festival carries a slight twinge of guilt, as the arrival of Hallowtide means that the gods can once again smite us for impiety.  The Land loses many of its bolder comedians around this time.</p>
<p>Each polity retains its own, idiomatic practices concerning Hallowtide.  That said, it is common for families to engage in gift-giving when the day arrives.  It is theorized by anthropologists that this is descended from an older practice whereby magicians would trade around their now-worthless magical artifacts in hopes of finding something that would still function in the mana drought that accompanies Hallowtide, if not prove useful when magic returned to the Land.  The practice has died out ever since magicians discovered that the magic systems that return at Gallowtide are usually different than the ones that left at Hallowtide, rendering their artifacts &mdash; in all probability &mdash; completely useless.</p>

Law-Poet Dirk Biodag (-50–314 After Fomorian Conflict) was an aes sidhe law-poet who practiced under the Uullor court. Famous for his negotiation of “infinite circle magic” cases, Dirk Biodag’s best-known work centers on the simultaneous ambiguity and implicit contractuality of communication. In one case, <i>Gwyllion Guise vs. The Uullor Court</i>, Biodag successfully established the immateriality of intentionality in implicit magic; in particular, in banishing via knife.</p></div>
<p><b>Early Life</b><br>
We know Biodag was born to a pair of ironsmiths, who died in their dangerous line of work when Biodag was 8. The next reference places Biodag’s arrival at the Uullor Court in 2 AFC, as the complainants’ lawyer in the case <i>The Descendents of Teg Tyl-Wyth v. Teg Tyl-Wyth</i>, notable for establishing the citizenship rights of changelings. He rose to minor celebrity status after serving as lawyer for both plaintiff and defendant in the case <i>Alderson v. Alderson</i>. He served primarily as a civil-suits lawyer for 100 years before being appointed Court Drafter by King Finvara.</p>
<p><b>Later Career</b><br>
As Court Drafter, Biodag was responsible for drafting and editing all legislation issued from the Uullor Court, magical or otherwise. His first action was to immediately and decisively issue the <u>“Standards, Styles, Spell Structures, and Most Definitive Hermeneutic Guidelines for All Legislation Hereby Issued by the Uullor Court”</u><sup>1</sup>, a document still used today (as of 1277 AFC). It is also worth considering that he considered <u>the controversial Good Neighbors Law</u><sup>2</sup> his greatest achievement.</p>
<p><b>Death</b><br>
Biodag died at the old age of 364 in a freak accident while visiting the still-active iron foundry his parents perished in. His tomb is inscribed with a quote from The Guide, “There is no magic but language; no language but life; no life but magic.”</p>

<p>17 Moon, 1277</p>
<p>Current Events Assignment: Necronomicon Ex Mortis</p>
<p>Necronomicon is ancient greek for, "book of the dead" (Willheart and Agony 120).  So the title translates to, "Book of the dead ex mortis".  It is named this because the book has death magic in it, which can be used to do evil (Torment 12-21) (Blight 157).  </p>
<p>The Necronomicon was found in the <u>Fell Corruption</u><sup>1</sup> where it was discovered by John Tyrant III (Tyrant 14).  Who had a name so good they had to use it three times.  He wrote, that it was inked in human blood and written on human skins (Tyrant 26).  The fell rituals are believed to have generated the fall of the <u>Arcadian Empire</u><sup>2</sup> and how it was swallowed up by the Choked Wood.  </p>
<p>Now the Necronomicon resides under the control of the Briarheart Circle, though many rumors which haven't been proven say that it has gone missing (Fetterley 688).  As a citizen of the world everyone has a duty to pay attention to said events.  </p>

Originally run by the Order of St Charity, it is now under the care of the Briarheart Sisters, who took over the orphanage following the extinction of the Order at the hands of <u>the Lady Disastrous</u><sup>2</sup>. While the Sisters officially run St Charity's purely as a social service, it is commonly whispered that children raised by the Sisters are briarmarked, as the orphanage boasts a disproportionate representation among those summoned by the Circle. The Circle's call is almost always for the wondrous and the unnatural, so it is no surprise that the Sisters maintain a supply line "in-house", so to speak.</p></div>
<p>It is worthwhile to note why it is that an institution like dear old St Charity's must exist. The truly <i>supernatural</i> is discontinuous, but the preternatural is highly tradition-bound. Even curses, when transmittable, are handed down in the context of a predecessor and successor, the one traditioning it to the other along with knowledge of its nature and behavior. Preternaturally-afflicted children usually lack this, and many parents abandon them when they cannot quickly find someone with the same affliction to take the child under their wing. Afflicted children without this tradition often face discrimination.</p>
<p>Because of the transmission vector of lycanthropy, lycanthropes are especially vulnerable to this. Even yours truly is sometimes held up from his appointments by roving Sibid ruffians looking for trouble! Even so, great strides are being made for the cause of justice. Personally, I am quite pleased that the Circle has seen fit this time to summon a council, against all odds, composed entirely of lycanthropes.</p>

The
warning signs were present in the very first file involving Mr. Baker who has since been vindicated of responsibility for his actions:</p></div>
<p><i>Subject: Cliff Baker</i><br>
<i>Occupation: Garbage Collector</i><br>
<i>Reason for Transplant: Severe Head Trauma due to auto accident</i><br>
<i>Donor: Dr. Felding, Historian at the University, Member of the Grove of the
Shining Lake and the Druidic Assembly of the Oak and Boar</i>.<br>
<i>Cause of donation: Congestive Heart Failure.</i></p>
<p><i>Notes:</i><br>
<i>Mr. Baker complains that his new brain keeps spouting random facts about History
which is a subject that he never liked.  Worse, it turns out that <u>Dr. Felding</u><sup>1</sup>
was a secret fan of Ohio State football, which sits ill upon Mr. Baker’s heart and
liver.  It keeps going on and on about how “that land” (Toledo Ohio) came into this
state , besides bringing in odd observations about Alsace Lorraine and how France
ultimately won because of the fays which makes Mr. Baker feel rather uncomfortable
since he does not believe in fairies and wishes he would stop seeing them during his
rounds.</i>
<i>Suggested Treatment: Since Mr. Baker’s post operation humoral disposition has
become cold and moist: 2 glasses of a dry and heating wine such as Cabernet
Sauvignon per diem and 1 session of <u>cognitive football therapy</u><sup>2</sup> per week.</i></p>
<p>This disastrous prescription (Mr. Baker weighed 120 lb’s and took his wine first
thing in the morning) led to a vicious spiral of auto-accidents, delayed trash
pickup, riots in the stadium, increased head-injuries and hence transplants, larger
numbers of patients for Dr. Ithloday, more bungled prescriptions and so on, leading
to the situation we have now.</p>

One was of rage, the other nameless loss.<br>
This sign certainly indicates the evidence of what many have feared: that The Land is being forgotten. </p></div>
<p>A certain scholar, having laboured this past week between the rising and the setting of the moon, conversing on occasion with the others of the Sibid Court~though they dwell in the hollows of the night, and Ullor Court rules the day, they are not as some suggest, "creatures of darkness," but even so love the beauty of the evening sky~discovered that the startling rouge of a small child's first glimpse of sunset, which he had been intending to dissect, had vanished.<br>
It had been placed in a container of starlight, as is done, but upon the next evening, the starlight held nothing but a salt rime like dried tears. <br>
Given the well-known preservative nature of woven starlight, this event has produced tremors in the Sibid Court and one must assume, despite their deep-seated omphaloskepsis,the Ullor Court as well, indicating an essential instability in the very fabric of The Land. Certain other signs, an arrangement of false stars in the shape of an empty cup, the Great Yew being late to flower, and other such occurrences have given rise to a certainty in the minds of many that the <u>Unweaving</u><sup>1</sup>, long feared, often ridiculed, may now be coming about. 
Although it many consider it unthinkable and indeed anathema, it is the opinion of some that the only solution left may be to breach the <u>First Contract</u><sup>2</sup>.<br>
It seems possible that the world of Man has ceased to remember the People, whether by story, or by heart, and with it, the People themselves may fade. It is imperative that all scholars, be they of either Court, take action by further study.</p>
