<div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>Author: Aret Bollhagen</h2><p>The esteemed Aret Bollhagen is a diabologian specializing in the intersection of arcanology, grammar, and applied theophysics. His interest in the arcane arts began when introduced to the myriad of religions throughout this fine land and the theopolitical tensions between them and the Circle. His paper, "On the emphasis of syllables in religious words," caused ripples not only in the Academy, but also inspired two books of theoretical arcanology, the creation of seven spells, a tear in reality, and no less than five duels from vengeful theologians. He currently resides as chair of Diabology at the Academy and spends most of his time avoiding students and making his papers as difficult to read as possible.</p></div>

<p></p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>Author: Tam Everal & Ansoni of the Red Ravine</h2><p>A young tree spirit rooted within the ancient forest of the Red Ravine, Tam Everal is considered a promising scholar who is best known for his studies of transient supernatural phenomena, most of which were conducted in the first few centuries of his life. More recently, however, in a time where older spirits have began to wither away, Everal has focused on preserving the priceless and sometimes cryptic knowledge of his elders.</p></div>
<p>Everal observes many of the Ravine's practices, including, to the dismay of outside academics, concealing the community's arcane knowledge. Almost all of Everal's publications are superficial warnings of imminent crises. Only during the last century, with Gallowtide approaching, did Everal began revealing some of his deeper and more startling discoveries.</p>
<p></p><p>Ansoni is the long-standing Red Ravine External Secretary, administering political and academic exchanges between the Ravine and the outside world. While her exact nature and origin is unknown, it is theorized that, because Ansoni's position requires her to interact extensively with non-Ravine individuals, the Red Ravine had carefully removed specific memories and magical abilities from Ansoni to prevent her from revealing any secret knowledge.</p>
<p>Still, Ansoni retained her intellect and political prowess, and she remains loyal to the Ravine. Yet, she often shares the curiosity of outside observers, personally advocating for a more open Ravine society. It is this unique position that recently 
convinced the Briarheart Circle to assign Ansoni the task of translating and communicating the works of Everal for the emergency council.</p>

His most well-known research projects are archaeological investigations of the traditions of the Land, the preservation of which he claims is the most important calling a scholar can have.
