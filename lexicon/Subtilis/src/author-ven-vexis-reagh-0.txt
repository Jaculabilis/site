# Title: Author: Ven. Vexis Reagh

The Venerable Vexis Reagh is an itinerant lecturer recognized as an expert on the history of ideas. His most well-known research projects are archaeological investigations of the traditions of the Land, the preservation of which he claims is the most important calling a scholar can have. Despite the abundance of lecture invitations he accepts, it is difficult to hear him speak in person, as due to his abnormally bad luck he is usually waylaid by some disaster on the way to the event. Outside of his academic work, he is a fervent supporter of lycanthropic rights.
