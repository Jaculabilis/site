As any schoolchild knows, religions in the Land are numerous as they are antagonistic, giving no quarter in their debates nor sacred duels. While one could go on (and indeed, many diabologians and theologians have) about the various arguments for superiority of deities each religion gives, or of the various gods, demigods, and semidemigods that have contested with each other for followers, it is important to take a step back and investigate two distinct and important issues.

1) Why are these religions so numerous, and why can they not get along?

2) What, if anything, constitutes an antithesis to the many religions?

It is in these two questions that diabology is most interested. However, one must note it is of considerable difficulty to study such lofty questions when [[the Academy]] is continually in a state of civil war between theologians, diabologians, [[arcanologists|arcanology]], and staff members attempting to justify their existence. Alas, such is the cost of the forward progress of academia.
