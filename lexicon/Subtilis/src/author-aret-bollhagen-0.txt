# Title: Author: Aret Bollhagen

The esteemed Aret Bollhagen is a diabologian specializing in the intersection of arcanology, grammar, and applied theophysics. His interest in the arcane arts began when introduced to the myriad of religions throughout this fine land and the theopolitical tensions between them and the Circle. His paper, "On the emphasis of syllables in religious words," caused ripples not only in the Academy, but also inspired two books of theoretical arcanology, the creation of seven spells, a tear in reality, and no less than five duels from vengeful theologians. He currently resides as chair of Diabology at the Academy and spends most of his time avoiding students and making his papers as difficult to read as possible.
