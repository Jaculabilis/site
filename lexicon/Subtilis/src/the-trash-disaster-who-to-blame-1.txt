# Title: The Trash Disaster: Who to Blame

Dr. Uriel Ithloday, freely and under no compulsion, admits to criminal negligence, lack of foresight and medically necessitated inebriation that prevented him from noticing that his patients were about to bury the known world under 3 meters of toxically enchanted trash. The
warning signs were present in the very first file involving Mr. Baker who has since been vindicated of responsibility for his actions:

//Subject: Cliff Baker//\\
//Occupation: Garbage Collector//\\
//Reason for Transplant: Severe Head Trauma due to auto accident//\\
//Donor: Dr. Felding, Historian at the University, Member of the Grove of the
Shining Lake and the Druidic Assembly of the Oak and Boar//.\\
//Cause of donation: Congestive Heart Failure.//

//Notes://\\
//Mr. Baker complains that his new brain keeps spouting random facts about History
which is a subject that he never liked.  Worse, it turns out that [[Dr. Felding]]
was a secret fan of Ohio State football, which sits ill upon Mr. Baker’s heart and
liver.  It keeps going on and on about how “that land” (Toledo Ohio) came into this
state , besides bringing in odd observations about Alsace Lorraine and how France
ultimately won because of the fays which makes Mr. Baker feel rather uncomfortable
since he does not believe in fairies and wishes he would stop seeing them during his
rounds.//
//Suggested Treatment: Since Mr. Baker’s post operation humoral disposition has
become cold and moist: 2 glasses of a dry and heating wine such as Cabernet
Sauvignon per diem and 1 session of [[cognitive football therapy]] per week.//

This disastrous prescription (Mr. Baker weighed 120 lb’s and took his wine first
thing in the morning) led to a vicious spiral of auto-accidents, delayed trash
pickup, riots in the stadium, increased head-injuries and hence transplants, larger
numbers of patients for Dr. Ithloday, more bungled prescriptions and so on, leading
to the situation we have now.
