# Title: Necronomicon Ex Mortis

Taz, this is a little short.  I have heard you argue during the more disruptive times in class.  You have it in you to be an excellent writer.  Your work could benefit from just a few minutes of proofreading and grammar checking!  

In your next draft please elaborate on the fell rituals of the Necronomicon as we read about in class yesterday, and the reasons why its theft is so important for a World Citizen to understand.
