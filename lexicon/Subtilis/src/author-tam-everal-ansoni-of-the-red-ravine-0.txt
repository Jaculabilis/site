# Title: Author: Tam Everal & Ansoni of the Red Ravine

A young tree spirit rooted within the ancient forest of the Red Ravine, Tam Everal is considered a promising scholar who is best known for his studies of transient supernatural phenomena, most of which were conducted in the first few centuries of his life. More recently, however, in a time where older spirits have began to wither away, Everal has focused on preserving the priceless and sometimes cryptic knowledge of his elders.

Everal observes many of the Ravine's practices, including, to the dismay of outside academics, concealing the community's arcane knowledge. Almost all of Everal's publications are superficial warnings of imminent crises. Only during the last century, with Gallowtide approaching, did Everal began revealing some of his deeper and more startling discoveries.
