# Title: The Lady Disastrous

**The Lady Disastrous** is one of three beings to take on the status of a cataclysm in her own person.  In this she is second to [[the Lord of Rivers' Wrath|Gwahair Sibeld]], and of the other we do not speak.  Unlike her peers, however, scholarly consensus holds the damage attributed to the Lady Disastrous was largely accidental.  It bears acknowledging that her Ladyship is a title of convenience: neither Court has ever bestowed lordship of disastrousness.  Indeed, the Lady Disastrous holds the historical distinction of claiming //neither// Court as a patron, as their simultaneous plotting to get her enrolled with the other Court left her completely adrift.

The Lady Disastrous was born Emile Vanislav in a mid-Hallows period.  Inducted into the Order of St. Charity at a young age, she swiftly rose through the ranks due to an unnatural series of accidents befalling those around her.  In many similar cases, such accidents would seem to be the result of malicious design, but young Vanislav was apparently both earnest and unable to control many of the damning factors that doomed her schemes.  For example, her elevation to Abbot was preceded by a deadly fire caused by a phlogiston muffin bake sale inside an Abbey made of lesser darkwood&mdash;although the reaction is known to us now, researchers would not discover it for another hundred moons after her time.

The historical record tells us of a career marked by increasingly ambitious attempts to do good marked by disproportionate backlashes.  These catastrophic attempts at charity often involved large-scale divine blessings gone unimaingably awry: one recalls, for example, that the Targeld region attained its contemporary status after a blessing to calm the native wildlife instead converted the populace into the first recorded lycanthropes.  And it hardly bears mentioning that, to this very day, worshippers must contend with the [[fallout|Tentacle-Induced Prayer Disruption]] of the time she blessed the [[Necronomicon Ex Mortis]].

The Order of St. Charity collapsed after the Lady Disastrous attempted to do their accounting //pro bono//.  Penniless and in disgrace, the Lady Disastrous died in 732 AFC attempting to give herself a haircut.
