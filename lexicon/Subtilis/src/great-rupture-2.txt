Excerpts from "On the Gods of the Great Rupture and the Subsequent Formation of the Religions of the Land"

The resources diabology provides scholars with are vast, but even they are stretched thin when studying the far reaching implications of the greatest metaphysical disaster the Land has ever known. In this paper I will forego any attempts to describe what exactly caused it (exempting a preliminary discussion on the use of an accented e in the word Blessed and how that began this whole sad state of affairs), and instead focus on the religious aspects, which are as numerous as they are conflicting.

...

The gods and demigods* that came from this disaster fought each other zealously for their very existence, as it is clear that reality can only contain so much divinity. When reality was shattered, the Land became the most hotly contested of all [[nine planes of reality|Planes of Reality]].** Scholars have hotly debated why the Land has been so fiercely fought over, but it is obvious that it is the intersection of the strong presence of arcanology, giving them followers not only willing to give them due oblation, but also warriors capable of dealing actual harm to their celestial rivals.

...

Needless to say quite a few deities found their champions in superior mortals (we all have experience the horrors of [[The Lady Disastrous]], who attempted to bring the Briarhart Circle under her dread grasp and was indeed only repelled by our knowledge of even [[fouler magicks|Necronomicon Ex Mortis]]*** than hers).

*Semidemigods did not spawn until at least 101 lunar cycles after the Great Rupture, some scholars argue for longer, on the order of 500, though none convincingly.

**Ohio being the only plane of reality over which none of the divine beings, not even the semidemigods, wished to contest, for obvious reasons.

***Indeed, fellow scholars, lycanthropes, students, and others, we will pay dearly for our crimes against reality.
