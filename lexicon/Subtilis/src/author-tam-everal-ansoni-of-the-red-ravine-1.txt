# Title: Author: Tam Everal & Ansoni of the Red Ravine

Ansoni is the long-standing Red Ravine External Secretary, administering political and academic exchanges between the Ravine and the outside world. While her exact nature and origin is unknown, it is theorized that, because Ansoni's position requires her to interact extensively with non-Ravine individuals, the Red Ravine had carefully removed specific memories and magical abilities from Ansoni to prevent her from revealing any secret knowledge.

Still, Ansoni retained her intellect and political prowess, and she remains loyal to the Ravine. Yet, she often shares the curiosity of outside observers, personally advocating for a more open Ravine society. It is this unique position that recently 
convinced the Briarheart Circle to assign Ansoni the task of translating and communicating the works of Everal for the emergency council.
