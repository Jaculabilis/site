# Title: Law-Poet Dirk Biodag


**Overview**\\
Law-Poet Dirk Biodag (-50–314 After Fomorian Conflict) was an aes sidhe law-poet who practiced under the Uullor court. Famous for his negotiation of “infinite circle magic” cases, Dirk Biodag’s best-known work centers on the simultaneous ambiguity and implicit contractuality of communication. In one case, //Gwyllion Guise vs. The Uullor Court//, Biodag successfully established the immateriality of intentionality in implicit magic; in particular, in banishing via knife.

**Early Life**\\
We know Biodag was born to a pair of ironsmiths, who died in their dangerous line of work when Biodag was 8. The next reference places Biodag’s arrival at the Uullor Court in 2 AFC, as the complainants’ lawyer in the case //The Descendents of Teg Tyl-Wyth v. Teg Tyl-Wyth//, notable for establishing the citizenship rights of changelings. He rose to minor celebrity status after serving as lawyer for both plaintiff and defendant in the case //Alderson v. Alderson//. He served primarily as a civil-suits lawyer for 100 years before being appointed Court Drafter by King Finvara.

**Later Career**\\
As Court Drafter, Biodag was responsible for drafting and editing all legislation issued from the Uullor Court, magical or otherwise. His first action was to immediately and decisively issue the [[“Standards, Styles, Spell Structures, and Most Definitive Hermeneutic Guidelines for All Legislation Hereby Issued by the Uullor Court”|The Guide]], a document still used today (as of 1277 AFC). It is also worth considering that he considered [[the controversial Good Neighbors Law|The Good Neighbors Law]] his greatest achievement.

**Death**\\
Biodag died at the old age of 364 in a freak accident while visiting the still-active iron foundry his parents perished in. His tomb is inscribed with a quote from The Guide, “There is no magic but language; no language but life; no life but magic.”
