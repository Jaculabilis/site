Elmadin Shadowspinner. Keeper of the Forgotten.
Member of the Sibid Court, dealer in forgotten childhood memories. Elmadin trades in the colour of the first bird seen by a baby in the Spring, the names of imaginary friends long abandoned, and young loversâ€™ second kisses.

These rare pieces of glamour he hoards, spending hours wrapped in the embrace of flickering tallow-light, tracing the threads of moonlight that tie the forgotten to each other and working tirelessly to find a way to stem the perpetual self-emptying of the World-dream.
