//-1500: The Founding of "Arcanology"//

**The Why**

Nearly 3000 years ago, on the cusp of [[Gallowtide|Gallowtide]] the Briarheart Circle declared a state of emergency in expectation of the historically disastrous return of new magic to the land. Given that magic systems inevitably change or are remade wholesale after the slate-clearing effects of [[Hallowtide]], the population of erstwhile magical practitioners had regularly dropped by over 50% as previously innocent incantations such as lighting one's cigarette with a small thumb-flame could result in summoning a greater demon. With the exception of certain 
(̶s̶o̶m̶e̶ ̶s̶a̶y̶ ̶p̶a̶r̶a̶n̶o̶i̶d̶,̶ ̶t̶h̶i̶s̶ ̶a̶u̶t̶h̶o̶r̶ ̶w̶o̶u̶l̶d̶:̶ ̶s̶a̶y̶ ̶r̶e̶a̶s̶o̶n̶a̶b̶l̶y̶ ̶p̶r̶e̶p̶a̶r̶e̶d̶)̶ magicians who may have happened to inscribe hexagrammic wards on each cigarette filter merely as a preemptory measure, many magicians perished in spectacularly gory and unpleasent ways. 

**Formation**

In an effort to avoid such drastic fluctuations in the magical population, and the accompanying logistical nightmare of producing supply/demand curve stabilization charms on a national scale, The Briarheart Council convened a new branch of [[The Academy]] whose primary task was to catalogue and identify new strains of magic as they emerged, cross-reference them with previous magical systems, and provide up-to-date risk analysis models in a timely manner to any magician who wished to emply prior magical systems.

Within the first decade of its inception, the field of Arcanology contributed to a significant decrease in accidental magical deaths(averaging ~40%), a figure that was previously unheard of within the first 300 years of a new Gallowtide and the previous process of supernatural selection that eventually resulted in a stable practitioner base.

Beyond the mere loss of life averted, however, the contributions to the stability of the magical commodities market resulted in significant financial gain.
