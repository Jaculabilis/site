<h1>Yanner's Inversion</h1>
<p>Because scholarly attention on the <a href="Parcum_Protomythos.html">Parcum Protomythos</a> has, as of late, focused on textual reconstruction, insufficient attention has been paid to the <i>content</i> of the texts. Of those guiding legends of the Nearside, few rival the influence of <b>Yanner's Inversion</b>. As the mythic <i>explanans</i> of the mochlomantic climate that allowed the emergence of the Pyroxenes, it is centrally placed in understanding Nearside heritage.</p>
<p>The Inversion was the magnum opus of the Archpraetor Fikrilin <i>deg</i> Yanner. In order to avert or sidestep an impending disaster -- there are a number of theories and oral traditions as to what this disaster was -- Yanner spent a year and a day preparing a world-shaping spell of <a href="Mochlomancy.html">mochlomancy</a>, the magic of levers. With the disaster imminent, Yanner unleashed a storm of arcane power that reversed the Nearside with its opposite. Because of her characteristic disregard for safety measures, however, the containment runes had been hastily sketched at only six lennings, and a breach resulted in a catastrophic containment failure. The spell was accidentally multicast several times, thrashing the Nearside back and forth seven times in the space of a chrononce. Per the legends, the mochlomantic reverberations unleashed by this event are the origin of the current destabilized mochlomantic climate.</p>
<p>Scholarly debate on the veracity of the Inversion centers around the possibility of Yanner's alleged spell, as necessary details to replicate it have been lost. While several prominent mochlomancers have stated that the legendary effects of the spell are impossible to replicate with any conceivable mochlomancy, dissension with this opinion has grown owing to theories that Yanner's spell fundamentally altered the mochlomantic background of the Nearside, making a repeat performance impossible.</p>
