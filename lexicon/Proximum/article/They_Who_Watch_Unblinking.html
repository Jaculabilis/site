<p>You are scholar-partisans of the Nearside compiling information on how the Pyroxenes effected the Replete Dominion in the face of Nexus efforts.</p>

<h1>They Who Watch Unblinking</h1>
<p>The principle of <a href="Mochlomancy.html">mochlomancy</a> is quite simple. Energy is redirected by applying said energy against a lever positioned on a fulcrum. <a href="Yanner27s_Inversion.html">Yanner's Inversion</a> is the most famous example of this, producing not only a new topology of earth, but breaking the topology of spacetime itself. Thus the <a href="Doglords_Imperious.html">Doglords</a> came to be known. Their eternal gaze has only been shared by a few, the most worthy of humans, the elite of the members of the Nearside. Robert Earthson was the first to venture to this strange new population and bring back the tidings of the lords. It is well known of their great stand against <a href="False_Reality.html">False Reality</a>, and of their tragic fall. But what Earthson uncovered trivializes even those actions. </p>
<p>The gaze of the Doglords is fixed in space, but not in time. Gazing towards the center of the torus, they see all time, and therefore, paradoxically, all things, for time was distorted as space was. They knew the rise of the Pyroxenes would come, they knew the Hollow Dominion would fail, and they chose their actions accordingly. What did they see in the future that gave them this confidence? Did they see hope, or despair? The sureness of victory leading to their sacrifice, or the inevitability of defeat giving way to despair? What motivated their actions? Did they see the <a href="Omnilever.html">omnilever</a>? Or did they see <a href="Calathas_the_Unholy.html">Calathas</a>?</p>
<p>Some suggest, and I am inclined to agree, though I tremble at the implication, that time has taken the exact curvature of space. Proof is impossible, and Yanner's exact spell is still somewhat a mystery. If this is true, then not even the Doglords would see this. Their defeat would be eternally repeated, their victory would be release. The Doglords, the starers into eternity, have risked all. </p>
<p>Only time will tell. And we have little left.</p>
