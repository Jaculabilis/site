<h1>Moment of Pardon</h1>
<p>The <b>Moment of Pardon</b> is a once-per-cycle event, observed in memory of the end of the 
first cycle, when the <a href="The_Indomitable_Semiheresy.html">Semiheresy</a> used brutal and excessive 
force to evict humanity from the Nearside, leading the deaths of 7,500 innocents.  The 
tragedy caused much turmoil for the next hundred years, and many feared that the end of 
the second cycle would be far more disastrous.  But clearer heads, miraculously, prevailed, 
and the Truth and Reconciliation Conference on Semiheresy was instituted to assist 
humanity in coming to terms with the necessity of facing the Pyroxene horrors at the end 
of every cycle.  </p>
<p>The outcomes of that conference are too numerous to list here, but the 
important one for our purposes was the Moment of Pardon.  Held at midnight 7,500 days 
before E-Day—in honor of the 7,500 victims of the first cycle—the Moment of Pardon is a 
time for all of us to acknowledge our strife and forgive our enemies, that we might stand 
as one on the literally unearthly battlefields of the False Reality.</p>
<p>As it is the function of the nobility to set a noble example for the common man, on this 
Moment of Pardon, I shall honor the custom publicly.  Of late, my foremost enemy has been 
one Dr. Edgar Ronson, a man with whom I have had no small number of academic debates, but 
more importantly was the man whose resource allocation decisions led to the end of my 
career in the Scholarium.</p>
<p>But I must admit that Dr. Ronson is a great man.  During the <a href="Lesser_Incursion.html">Lesser Incursion</a>, he 
developed vital upgrades for the <a href="Gravitational_Containment_and_Vacuum_Sealing.html">GCVS systems</a>
by an ingenius application of the <a href="Key_and_Lock_Principle.html">Key and Lock Principle</a>, even when doing so required 
making the controversial decision to seal off Parliament and the last remnant of the 
<a href="Jurist-Knights.html">Jurist-Knights</a> and their Semiheretic auxiliary forces.  There are those who questioned 
his decision, but not I, for we both understand that we can hold nothing back against the 
odious Pyroxenes.</p>
<p>Dr. Ronson's character also shines through in his support of Robert Earthson, <a href="Zymurgy_Sanctions.html">the hero of 
our age</a>, and the necessity of constructing the <a href="Omnilever.html">Omnilever</a> so that 
we may defeat our foes once and for all.  "[The Scholarium] stands with Earthson," he once 
told me in private communication.  And so I speak the words instituted by tradition: "Here 
is a man who I will gladly fight beside."</p>
