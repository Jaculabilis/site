<h1>Zymurgy Sanctions</h1>
<p>Sitting here sipping a Semibock with Sir Calvinson owner of the Doppleheretic, "Habebo Corpus Tuum" playing in the background, it is a good time to reflect on Zymurgy and the law.  This brewery opened right before the ill-fated effort of Vidiculturists to use the <a href="Vineman_Convention.html">Vine-Man's Convention</a> to outlaw all grain.  You can still see the scorch marks left by <i>Etna Fire</i> drawn from <i>Vulcan's Forge</i>.</p>
<p>However, the worst <b>Zymurgy sanctions</b> were instituted by the <a href="Jurist-Knights.html">Jurist-Knights</a>, the masters of Nomohypnosis.  People sing of them now, and indeed, from a distance many of their feats were quite colorful, daring and useful to society.  But everything that they achieved was through the most extreme, deliberate cultivation of the <i>Archetype of the Boring</i> in the <i>Endless Library</i>.  The Template Machines were indeed a crime against Goodness, Truth and Beauty.  We owe the knights a toast and debt of song there.  Unfortunately, it is not possible to forever hold the will in the <i>Aisle of Dry Dust</i> without going mad, which is why it is so important in that kind of work to visit the springs of <i>Lesser Lethe</i>, the <i>Elysian Fields</i> or the <i>Hamlets of Demeter and Bacchus</i> unless you have someone to spot you constantly.  Even then, and the knights were careful at first, overconfidence can undermine the spotter, and both can wither away lost in the quantity of endless and irrelevant truths leading out into the void.</p>
<p>In this fatal madness, like a rabid dog that fears water, they fought against that which could have saved them:  Beer.  Fortunately or unfortunately, the <a href="Aberidus.html">Aberidus</a> turned on, causing the inhabitants of the Nearside to lose all interest in representative government and spirit restrictions.  The few remaining knights, seeing the tide go against them, launched into the <i>Endless Filibuster</i>.  They are still there and all attempts to rescue them and the other five MP's have failed.  The Parliament building was sealed off after the <a href="Lesser_Incursion.html">Lesser Incursion</a> and further rescue efforts are deemed too dangerous because of the Pyroxenes now sleeping there.  I still remember what the <a href="The_Year_of_the_Waiting.html">Year of the Waiting</a> looked like.  Walking toward the Nearside, the time differential made for a blur of activity which suddenly stopped.  </p>
<p>Now that we have survived thus far, it is our sacred duty as Zymurgists to bring peace and unity to a troubled Nearside, to heal those broken by ennui, to give rest to minds shattered by arcane depths, to bring inspiration to our best minds, to transcend logic and individuality, to save not the human race but the human soul!</p>
