<p>You are scholar-partisans of the Nearside compiling information on how the Pyroxenes effected the Replete Dominion in the face of Nexus efforts.</p>

<h1>Parcum Protomythos</h1>
<p>In some ways I prefer ancient history.  Linear time and linear space make things nice and straight forward.  Still our post-Yanner world has its perks.  After all, now that most of what remains of humanity is cornered in the Nearside, we get about two hundred minutes to slowly sip a beer or something stronger for each minute that the Pyroxenes get to grow in.  This gives you time to contemplate your fate and wonder if <i>they</i> will think of something.  Maybe our grandkids will know what to do.</p>
<p>Hopefully the <a href="Doglords_Imperious.html">Great Mastiffs</a> will still be around by then.  Let's be honest, we owe them a lot.  Space may be tight now, and they have no known economic value anymore, but if our species is going to cease to exist outside the realm of <a href="False_Reality.html">False Reality</a> then, even though the calculations are uncertain, I think we would have better deep leverage if we did not have dogblood on our hands.  Besides, given some of the prophetic hints in the Protomythos, we may yet need what is left of their minds.  Call me a Semiheretic if you like.</p>
<p>My friends have asked me to write an article about the <b>Parcum Protomythos</b>.  (Or rather, dared me to write about dog bedding.)  While many have questioned the Latin of the title, it is not an error, since there is no Magnus Protomythos.  It is "A Little Thing: The First Myth."  It was written as seven million ideograms on separate leafs of parchment.  Many of them are works of the highest calligraphy; some of them are hapax legomena whose meaning can only be guessed now.  Mochlomantic leverage in the deep realms near <a href="Archimedes27_Rock.html">Archimedes' Rock</a> has revealed probable meanings for some, but others have baffled even the finest representatives of the Scholarium.</p>
<p>Even though it arose after <a href="Yanner27s_Inversion.html">Yanner's Inversion</a> due to the unstable warping of time, the Mastiffs' civilization is actually the longest lived on our planet, something like seven-thousand years of Pre-Yanner time, eclipsing ancient Egypt, its only human rival.  Since their glory days lasted only a few decades of human history and since they were already in severe decline by the time that <a href="Xi_Lupon2C_PhD.html">Xi Lupon</a> inadvertently removed the grounding from their minds by learning the first sign of their language thus bringing human mochlomantic space into contact with their unlevered existence (and the fact that they always looked like dogs and now act like them) there is a strong tendency to treat them as mere animals. </p>
<p>The sad tendency of the Protomythos to regard us as divine or angelic beings also reinforces our very human prejudices.  Yet, if you can dig deeply, there is so much wisdom hidden there, so much depth, so much beauty, so much meaning upon meaning, layer upon layer, depth under depth, height upon height, it is like the perfect seven-thousand-year-old barley wine with unbelievable complexity and depth of flavor making everything produced by us look like a homebrewer's first attempt at a three-percent ale, not even a day out of the fermenter.</p>
<p>The contents, the contents of the First Myth, the most recent revelation in the World:   I don't think our languages can do justice to them.  Most of the scholarly controversies in this area boil down to the inadequacies of translation, and attempts to correlate the narratives with known events in our history.  The most famous passage of recent years is that which relates to the infamous necromancer <a href="Calathas_the_Unholy.html">Calathas the Unholy</a>.  It looks like it was actually a prophecy made three thousand years of their time before his baleful effects were felt in the Nearside, though intractable problems with our understanding of the language and chronology make this a disputed point and it is not known how they achieved this without levers.  I have too little space left here even to begin to outline all that can be said of surviving examples of origin tales, history and lunar poetry contained in the Protomythos.</p>
<p>If such flowers can blossom and perish in a day, what else could be hidden out there in the folds of our fragmented world?</p>
