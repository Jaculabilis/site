<h1>Lennings</h1>
<p>Though I look upon the <a href="Tractatus_Logico-Thaumaturgus.html">Tractatus Logico-Thaumaturgus</a> with skepticism, here is where I must concede that it serves its reader well. <b>Lennings</b> are a fundamental practice of <a href="Mochlomancy.html">Mochlomancy</a>, a fulcrum to the magical lever. The more lennings employed, the more stable the spell. However, to employ a lenning requires costly power, and so one sacrifices power for stability, hence the neverending search for <a href="Archimedes27_Rock.html">Archimedes' Rock</a>, the final lenning, which would allow a mochlomantic spell to have perfect stability with no tax on the power. This problem has vexed researchers for years, and more recently has come to the forefront of the <a href="Yanner27s_Inversion.html">inversion</a> phenomenon. Robert Earthson has been working on his <a href="Omnilever.html">omnilever</a> for quite some time, but even this fantastical invention, would not be able to function without stability, and to create lennings powerful enough to stabilize such a device would drain all power from the system. But with a device that provides its own stability would dodge such a difficulty. Scholarium metaphysicists, including myself, have postulated that if such a device were to exist, it is conceivable that we could reverse the damned effects Yanner wrought decades ago.</p>
<p>The search continues, and it is my professional opinion that it is a fable, a myth. But it is a hope, and in these final hours I must confess before all, that it is a hope I myself indulge in.</p>
