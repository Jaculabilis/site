<h1>Fourth Season</h1>
<p>The Fourth Season is illegal.  Therefore most people believe that it exists since why legislate against something that isn't there?  Of course that argument would never have stopped the <a href="Jurist-Knights.html">filibustering Latin-tongued bores</a>.</p>
<p>It is an artifact, a false prediction of the obsessive <a href="Bivalence_Genera.html">binary division</a> of reality put forward by the half-brained <a href="The_Indomitable_Semiheresy.html">semi-heretics</a>.     Why is it that the half-hearted enforcers want to push humanity into the chitinous horrors of H. G. Orwell's worst nightmares?  The answer lies in their very half-heartedness!  True full-blooded heretics, who have truly embraced the ideal of heresy for its own sake, would never stoop to such trite apocalyptic orthodoxy!  They would reject them <i>de priore</i> as beneath their dignity! </p>
<p>Ancient Egypt had three seasons:  Planting, Flood and Harvest.  Even if you insist on nostalgic archaeogaiism, there is no need for powers of two.  Does <a href="Tractatus_Logico-Thaumaturgus.html">Robert Earthson</a> ever lend support to the notion of a Fourth Season?  It is merely a passing fad!</p>
<p>Scintillate, Jazzy and Negative are the only real seasons on the Nearside.  Let me explain them since, apparently it isn't clear to you yet: Scintillate when the magnetic fields of the two disks of the donut moon visible from here cause all long haired dogs (and cats) too give off dangerous static charges and women look rather pretty;  Jazzy, when all the tides are pulled out of the harbors giving a spectacular natural amphitheatre for jazz concerts in the temperate zones; Negative, very dangerous for people with up-gravitational orientation which becomes much stronger at this time (they also tend to get rather irritable and negative.)</p>
<p>Those killjoys!  The end of negative and beginning of scintillate is the best time of cycle for the heroic sport of <a href="Lesser_Incursion.html">moon jumping</a> for those of us who can (and have you ever heard of a semi-heretic with up-gravitation?)  No they will <a href="Omnilever.html">kill for beer</a> and even then, it is only cold-bloodedly for power, like dead dogs.</p>
