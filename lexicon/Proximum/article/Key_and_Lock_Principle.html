<h1>Key and Lock Principle</h1>
<p>A groundbreaking theorem proven by noted metaphysicist <a href="Shahan_Fuizhen.html">Shahan Fuizhen</a>, the statement was postulated first by <a href="Xi_Lupon2C_PhD.html">Xi Lupon</a> in the late 2nd decade, but only proven in the mid 4th decade. The statement itself is simple and as follows:</p>
<p><b>For every lock there must be a key, and for every key there must be a lock.</b></p>
<p>For all his repoire, Xi never was able to prove it, and in fact eventually came of the opinion that it was not true. When Dr. Fulzhen proved it five hours after reading about it, quite a few prestigious members of the Scholarium suggested striking Xi's name from Scholarium history for his incompetency, but his fame was still well revered, so it was decided to allow his good name, and even the award associated therein, persist. Evidently this lack of academic competency still lingers to this day, as there are some who still hold him as well revered in the metaphysicist community, and would rather cite him and resort to petty ad hominems than do actual research.</p>
<p>This principle is of great import for a number of reasons, the primary of which is that it guarantees the <a href="Pendulous_Passage.html">Pendulous Passage</a> to be ever accessible, no matter how well sealed. This is, of course, not to say that defense projects are hopeless, far from it. It is rather to encourage vigilance, as ever will persist the threat of incursion. Another fact that proceeds is that the <a href="Fourth_Season.html">Fourth Season</a> will be knowable and controllable given enough R&D, which I urge the Scholarium and Nexus to put more funding towards.</p>
