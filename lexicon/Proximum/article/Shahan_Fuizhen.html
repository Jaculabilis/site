<p>You are scholar-partisans of the Nearside compiling information on how the Pyroxenes effected the Replete Dominion in the face of Nexus efforts.</p>

<h1>Shahan Fuizhen</h1>
<p><i>The following were excerpted from a Semiheresy internal memo leaked by an anonymous source.</i></p>
<p>[...] resolved with the utmost haste. Though his powerful contacts in the upper echelons of the Scholarium allow him to maintain a behind-the-scenes position of <i>de facto</i> control, in his unnatural and abhorrent old age he has grown too paranoid. The threads of loyalty he holds so tightly are fraying. I suppose lackeys are only willing to cover up so many Pyroxene ritual murders before they start to rethink their devotions. I even heard from a demipriest that some now suspect he's been dead for decades and mock his extant body as <a href="Pendulous_Passage.html">"Shahang"</a>, a wretched, soulless husk "hanging on" in a diabolical mockery of life. (Ah, for the idyllic disputes of academia!) Speaking of [...]</p>
<p>[...] remains a potent foe to our hegemony in the Nearside. He has, in anticipation of the upcoming <a href="Fourth_Season.html">fourth season</a>, pushed for it to be made an open research topic. You and I both know that the Semiheresy cannot allow [REDACTED] to be enunciated by Scholarium personnel. If only he were willing to have his tongue cut out like <a href="Xi_Lupon2C_PhD.html">Dr. Lupon</a>, but the fool insists on keeping his most dangerous weapon. And the eagerness with which he moved to strike Lupon from Scholarium history? He strikes me as someone with a lot to hide.</p>
<p>In truth, Osmodius, I see no hypothesis so compelling as that Dr. Fuizhen either was from the beginning, or became after researching too far into depths best left unplumbed, an agent for the Pyroxenes in human skin. No son of the Nearside would have thought to call that nightmare realm "True Reality", even resignedly. His <i>Atlas Arcanum</i> contains too many errors and "inspired" leaps for how accurate his conclusions have been. I cannot shake the fear that through him the Pyroxenes have been perusing the depths of Nexus archives since the last cycle. It is too much of a coincidence that we had kept the Pyroxenes at bay for cycles, yet as soon as he discovered <a href="Key_and_Lock_Principle.html">the principle of bypassing the defenses</a> on the Passage, the Pyroxenes immediately broke through them. In fact, I just submitted my latest report on that damnable incident, which [...]</p>
<p>[...] and as for Dr. Fuizhen, our patience has borne the expected fruit. It will not be difficult to move on him. We only await the approval of the warrants.</p>
