<h1>Bivalence Genera</h1>
<p>Theoretical research in the Scholarium has uncovered, frustratingly, <i>five</i> bivalent phenomena underlying the Nearside's metaphysical ecology. Collectively, they are called the <b>bivalence genera</b>:</p>
<p><i>Semiside bivalance</i> is, of course, the existence of both our Nearside and the True Reality (also called the Turnways Reality). This is sometimes called the <i>primary bivalence</i> or <i>master bivalence</i>, since the other bivalences have only been found within the Nearside [1].</p>
<p><i>Gravitational bivalence</i> is the phenomenon where those who are born in the Nearside have, with roughly equal chance, one of two gravitational alignments: either "in" towards the Nearside, or "out" away from it. While living with out-valence was possible before if one was careful, the development of <a href="Gravitational_Containment_and_Vacuum_Sealing.html">gravitational technology</a> has greatly reduced the mortality rate for out-valents.</p>
<p><i>Radial bivalence</i>, also known as <i>blink bivalence</i>, is the phenomenon across the inner and outer sides of the the Nearside torus. While we live on the outer side, the inner side is inhabited by the inside-out ones, <a href="They_Who_Watch_Unblinking.html">They Who Watch Unblinking</a>, who look unceasingly to the center.</p>
<p>The final and most problematic bivalence is <i>season bivalence</i>, which has frustrated Scholarium researchers for decades. There are, as we all learned in school, three seasons in the Nearside: scintillate, jazzy, and negative. However, after researchers failed to reduce one of the seasons to a linear combination of the others, it was discovered that the seasons are actually a double bivalence, with the unknown <a href="Fourth_Season.html">fourth season</a> having been banned by the Nexus. This has stymied all subsequent attempts to systematize the bivalence genera.</p>
