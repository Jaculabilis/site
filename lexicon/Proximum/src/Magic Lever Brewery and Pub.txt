# Title: Magic Lever Brewery and Replete Pub

The effects of the existentialist disaster, [[The Year of the Waiting]], have been well documented, but none are so prominent, none so wrapped in mystery, as the greatest bar to rise of the ashes of society, the **Magic Lever Brewery and Replete Pub**.  

Now, it is a well-established fact that bars were some of the few establishments to consistently thrive under the Aberidus' influence. The Magic Lever Brewery and Replete Pub was founded by Ibrahim Reed, and became stronger after the founder devoted much effort into infusing his brews with ingredients to stave off the horrifying effects of ennui. His bar was unknown until Robert Earthson met with the philosopher and inventor. After this meeting, it was revealed that he had a unique and singularly unexpected insight into the mechanics of the Aberidus, and the public flocked to his pub. 

Earthson is associated with this bar, leading it to be a locus of myth and legend. Ibraham's middle name is Archimedes, leading to the pop legend that the pub's foundation, [[Archimedes' Rock]], is the actual concept noted in [[Tractatus Logico-Thaumaturgus]], as if the metaphor were an actual physical object. An amusing urban legend to be sure, likely stemming from the fact that the disaster was halted here.
