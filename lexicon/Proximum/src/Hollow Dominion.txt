# Title: Hollow Dominion

The Pyroxenes rose and the land of the proud Nearside began falling away under their corrupting gaze. The effects of Ignis Ignotus grew and corrupted even the noblest of souls. The end was nigh. But there were those noble beings, those canine gods, the Doglords, who resisted. They struck a mighty blow to the Pyroxenes and halted the coming of the Replete Dominion, carving out a small circle of hope and reality in the cursed [[False Reality]] known as the **Hollow Dominion**.

The Doglords held this line for the majority of the first and second decades. It was only when [[Xi Lupon|Xi Lupon, PhD]] delved into works he was not qualified to handle that they began to falter. Their strength relied on their unlevered existence, and Xi mixed levered and unlevered realities, shifting the fulcrum of their existence and allowing the Pyroxenes to again press the advantage. The Doglords faded in their appearance and behavior as a [[result|Parcum Protomythos]].

It is from this tragedy that noted metaphysicist, [[Dr. Fuizhen|Shahan Fuizhen]], in his acknowledgment of the monumental mistake of Xi, solved the Key and Lock Principle and motioned to strike Xi's memory from Scholarium history. Alas, some held to the opinion that he still deserved his name, and so his legacy lives on to this day. In a drunken despair Dr. Fuizhen lamented the Doglord's sacrifice and wished that they had never descended to save those who would only [[glorify their betrayer|False Reality]].

After the fall of the Hollow Dominion the False Reality grew in size and potency. It was with great reluctance that Dr. Fuizhen had to acknowledge that, with the hollowness filled and the falseness growing, it was of metaphysical definition True. His confession of this led to the marshalling of Nexus resources to combat this terror, which preserved society through the [[Lesser Incursion]].
