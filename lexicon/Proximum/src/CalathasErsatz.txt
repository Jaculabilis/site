# Title: Calathas the Unholy

For anyone who has ever bothered to study the society of late old earth, it is obvious that Calathas the Unholy is a very common literary trope of the kind inspired by H. P. Lovecraft, the founder of the eponymous Free Love movement.  The only positive evidence for its existence is to be found in wads of dog-bedding quoted by Scholastics with a vested interest in producing paperwork; Duke Strato's proclamations with their constant need to create enemies without and heroes within to deflect attention from numerous scandals, incompetencies and executions; references from dog-worshippers who lack the mental coherence to be full heretics; and the beer induced ravings of that drunken sot and dabbler in the Kupakamasutra Robert Earthson.  Latin rhythms about court room super men are too ridiculous for further mention.

Many people find Calathas a convenient //Diabolus ex machina// to explain the demise of the [[Doglords|Doglords Imperious]], the reduction of the human population by 99.73%, the prevalence of necromantic cults, the existence of hordes of ravenous chitin and metal monstrosities, long lines for New You(TM) [[Aberidus]] Templates, [[Shahan Fuizhen's|Shahan Fuizhen]] bad hair, and unpredictably long IIPA hangovers.  It is ridiculous! It is laziness!  If you don't understand something, go to Vulcan's Forge yourself and move the Cyclopean levers, don't invent ghosts and hobgoblins like our benighted ancestors (Earthson included)!
