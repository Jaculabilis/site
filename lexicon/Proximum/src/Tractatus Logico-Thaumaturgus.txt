# Title: Tractatus Logico-Thaumaturgus

Walking by the execution grounds next to the Western Ducal palace, a crowd of [[Semi-Heretics|The Indomitable Semiheresy]] chanting "The [[Fourth Season]] is at hand!" tried to push me and several others towards an eastern airlock, until, seeming to recognize me, they started to shout:  "Fido!  Fido is here!".  Ah!  The topoi we live in!  

Now that I am ensconced in a contorted looking yet cozy booth at Euclid's Folly, sipping a magnificent Stout of Unknowing: thick, dark brown head; creamy body; slightest hint of carbonation; a black void echoing with brown sugar, chocolate, raisins, coffee and hyper-berries from the Four-fold Peak,  it reminds me of the fragrant night that reigned in the Hollow Sphere, a region where the land curves up on all sides and there is no sky, but all the up-gravitating plants and trees, with all the soil clinging to them, have flown to the center forming a great island of unseen green, the Tree of Life, the Yggdrasil, a place of contemplation, reflection and meditation.  It was there that I realized my mistake.  It was there that I met my wife.

In some ways it is a pity that the Scholarium adopted Latin for its language.  It has given it a somewhat rigid approach to mochlomancy, epitomized by the **Tractatus Logico-Thaumaturgus** which I composed as younger, more confident man.  As Euclid's propositions formed the basis of geometry, yet are clearly insufficient for this pub, so too the Tractatus became //the// textbook for all beginning mochlomancers, yet it is not adequate for all the phenomena to be found in the //Realm of Deep Things//.  It defined all the basics: the difference between wands and levers; geo-mantic orientation; [[lennings]]; proper etiquette and attire; dietary recommendations; enunciation and elocution; preliminary trances; woodworking skills; metal alloys; the symbolism of the smith; the uses of fire; doors and hinges; seesaws and swings, everything that seemed important at that time.

The older I get, the more I learn of things I do not know.  The Scholarium has spent hundreds of standard years teaching and commenting upon my book.   I am, as it were, younger than my own descendants.  How can I be sure that they are not wiser than I?
