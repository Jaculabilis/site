# Title: Bivalence Genera

Theoretical research in the Scholarium has uncovered, frustratingly, //five// bivalent phenomena underlying the Nearside's metaphysical ecology. Collectively, they are called the **bivalence genera**:

//Semiside bivalance// is, of course, the existence of both our Nearside and the True Reality (also called the Turnways Reality). This is sometimes called the //primary bivalence// or //master bivalence//, since the other bivalences have only been found within the Nearside [1].

//Gravitational bivalence// is the phenomenon where those who are born in the Nearside have, with roughly equal chance, one of two gravitational alignments: either "in" towards the Nearside, or "out" away from it. While living with out-valence was possible before if one was careful, the development of [[gravitational technology|Gravitational Containment and Vacuum Sealing]] has greatly reduced the mortality rate for out-valents.

//Radial bivalence//, also known as //blink bivalence//, is the phenomenon across the inner and outer sides of the the Nearside torus. While we live on the outer side, the inner side is inhabited by the inside-out ones, [[They Who Watch Unblinking]], who look unceasingly to the center.

The final and most problematic bivalence is //season bivalence//, which has frustrated Scholarium researchers for decades. There are, as we all learned in school, three seasons in the Nearside: scintillate, jazzy, and negative. However, after researchers failed to reduce one of the seasons to a linear combination of the others, it was discovered that the seasons are actually a double bivalence, with the unknown [[fourth season|Fourth Season]] having been banned by the Nexus. This has stymied all subsequent attempts to systematize the bivalence genera.
