Hail, great and eternal Fido! Pursuant to the investigation into the Lesser Incursion to which you have assigned me, I humbly submit this Warrant of Arrest for a number of chief suspects. The extreme measures taken by the Semiheresy in the wake of the Incursion have led to a record number of charges of treason, far surpassing our quarterly goal. We expect the trials to be open-and-shut cases with some quick sentences of semideath. If it be your will, please ordain that the warrant be approved and promulgated to the field enforcers of the Semiheresy:
