# Title: Doglords Imperious

Hail, great canines! In their name I dedicate this Lexicon to the **Doglords Imperious**, those august and wise powers that be whose Nexus so benevolently sustains us. Yea, the Doglords who have ruled the Nearside from time immemorial graced we humble pilgrims with the means to survive in the Nearside in our hour of need, and still today we live by their decrees.

Indeed, we owe to them our greatest scholarly achievements. I hardly dare to begin enumerating their benefits, lest I shall never cease, but 'twas by their charity that we were allowed to discover among the papers they used for bedding and waste the fragments of the [[Protomythos|Parcum Protomythos]]. Only through the patronage of Sparky the Inviolable did [[Vineman|Vineman Convention]] produce such fruit as the GCVS systems, for which our researchers were rewarded with a second donation of Protomythos pages, this time only slightly soiled. It was these seven thousand pages, each enscribed with a single, illuminated letter, which we were able to rearrange into the [[//Folly of Calathas//|Folly of Calathas, The]]. Remember, ye Nearsiders: remember the debt ye owe to the Doglords.

Stray not from the path they have set. Fie, fie, I say, fie upon those who would resist their doctrines! May the accursed Pyroxenes rue the day that they dared to oppose their designs to the [[Hollow Dominion]] of the Doglords Imperious, whose barks ring everlasting!
