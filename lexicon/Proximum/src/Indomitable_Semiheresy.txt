# Title: The Indomitable Semiheresy

The history leading up to the founding of the **Indomitable Semiheresy** is well known: The people of Earth were stranded in True Reality by Yanner's reckless use of [[that cataclysmic art|Mochlomancy]]. With the aid of the Nexus, most made it through the [[Pendulous Passage]] back to Earth, now the Nearside. Research on [[Ignis Ignotus]] turned the benign substance into an [[existential threat|Vineman Convention]] and required the development of [[containment systems|Gravitational Containment and Vacuum Sealing]]. Yet these precautions were insufficient.

As the [[fourth season|Fourth Season]] approached, the Nexus bowed to necessity and established the Indomitable Semiheresy. The semiheretics were charged with evicting the residents of the Nearside at the end of negative until the beginning of scintillate. The name was given to evoke a sense of irrevocability about the //novus ordo// of the cycles and reflect the bittersweet task of its acolytes: though they were the shepherds of humanity, they did so by, for a season, exiling them from safety.

Historically, the Indomitable Semiheresy was given great doctrinal leeway by the Nexus. This became contentious in the last 10th decade when, following academic strife between the Semiheresy and the Scholarium, a previously-unpublished manuscript of the eminent [[Dr. Lupon|Xi Lupon, PhD]] appeared on the desk of the head editor of [[Levers and Lagers|Levers and Lagers: A Fond Farewell]]. The manuscript implicated several Half-Heresiarchs in a conspiracy to cause the experimental disaster that mutated Ignis Ignotus into the transmogrant it is today. The same manuscript also raised concerns that the Semiheresy was a viper's nest of undercover [[Pyroxene sympathizers|Pyroxene Sympathizers]]. This spawned a brief trend of calling it the Domitable Semiheresy, which wasn't funny the first time either, you //cretins//.
