Together these form the only reliable method of halting the spread of [[Ignis Ignotus]]
  and preserving the values and beauty of civilization for which the Near Side is known.  
While I can respect the Pyroxenes' decision to embrace Ignis Ignotus, it is because of the very irrevocability of it, 
and I think they are well aware of this, if they are aware of anything anymore.  
It is a wondrous and awe inspiring leap into the unknown, but we cannot afford to risk 
everything we have brought with us to the Near Side.  So complete separation by vacuums and reverse gravity fields 
are the only viable option until science progresses to another age.  
The fond hope of many [[Pyroxene Sympathizers]] is that the Replete Dominion itself will bring about a rapid
positive change if only we would turn off the energy fields.  If they wish to do so individually, I respect them, 
but collectively, we must keep up gravitational containment and vacuum sealing.
