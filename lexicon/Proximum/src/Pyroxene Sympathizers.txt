# Title: Pyroxene Sympathizers

Oh, you fools, you fools!  How long must you allow this evil in your midst?  How long, 
while you squabble for wealth and political power, while you increase your own status, 
while you let your very society crumble around you?

The hour is late, the cycle's end upon us, and you have all forgotten the horrors of the 
hell across the Passage!  Remember the Pyroxenes, those demons of metal and chitin, hunger 
and hatred!  Remember how they scythed through the wretched rabble of humanity that 
broke before them like a hammer meets glass!  Aye, bow to them, kneel to them, supplicate 
them, and all you will have achieved is a faster death!  They do not tire!  They do not 
negotiate!  They do not turn from their purpose!  For behind them is oblivion, and before 
them lies the shining light of the Nearside and the lifeblood of its peoples.  What 
creature would turn away, especially one so assured of its right to seize and slaughter?

Will the [[Semiheresy|The Indomitable Semiheresy]] save you?  Those craven slaves of the 
[[Doglords|Doglords Imperious]] who would rather throw their race to the demons than take 
a stand against their cruel masters?  Aye, no wonder the sympathizers have infiltrated 
their accursed ranksâ€”to the highest order, the very highest!

Will the Scholarium save you?  That bumbling cripple of an institution, whose 
[[treacherous leader|Shahan Fuizhen]] evicts his own and worships the Pyroxenes behind 
closed doors?  Whose flunkies [[mock the noble|Key and Lock Principle]] and 
[[scorn precious lore|Folly of Calathas, The]]?  Who [[unleashed|Ignis Ignotus]] our 
bitter foe in their lust for power?

Will the [[Jurist-Knights]] save you?  Ah, but they have passed into myth, slain by 
the [[culmination|Aberidus]] of our cruel and uncaring science!  No heroes remain in this 
twilight age.  No heroes, save only [[one|Tractatus Logico-Thaumaturgus]]!

There are [[those|Calathas the Unholy]] among the ravening hordes who were once human.  
Ignis Ignotus damned them //forever//.  Yes, //damnation//, and nothing less, is what lies 
behind the [[energy shields|Gravitational Containment and Vacuum Sealing]]!  Does your 
neighbor, does your friend tell you that Paradise awaits beyond?  Then strike him down, 
for he is your enemy!  For Paradise is //here//, this oasis of safety, this beacon in the 
darkness.  

I beg you, do not surrender it to the night.
