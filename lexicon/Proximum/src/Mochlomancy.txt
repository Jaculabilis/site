I would like to rant more about the [[Vine-Man's|Vineman Convention]] closure of the Fourth Season Bar for an illegal performance of Vivaldi.  But really, the role of zymourgists in the Nexus is to promote brotherly comradery against the real enemy, and with Origin Day approaching this jazzy time of year is a good one for historical reflection through the golden, forgiving glow of a good Belgian [[Trivalence|Bivalence Genera]].

It's hard to believe, but long ago, before [[Yanner| Yanner's Inversion]] turned Earth into a three dimensional sphere pasted over a four dimensional torus, when half of all plants and animals started to up-gravitate and it required a PhD in Topology to find the nearest pub for years until they got GPS to work again, mochlomancy was not a household name.  (Yes I know, some people claim that Yanner's spell was impossible, but something turned our planet into a hyper-doughnut whose inner half (which used to be Australia, Brazil and Michigan) is now full of [[beings that gaze towards a center in the fourth dimension|They Who Watch Unblinking]], and that something was Yanner!)  Before the Archpraetor's day, mochlomancy was a small obscure movement of particle physicists, Feng Shui experts and conventional thaumaturges searching for [[Archimedes' Rock]] after the failure of cold fusion in solving the energy crisis of those days. 

Now, it is ubiquitous.  Everything from the proper design of taproom levers, to incantations for the stabilization of quark stars to the Kupakamasutra is based on mochlomantic principles.  So here's to Yanner; here's to [[Shahan Fuizhen]]; here's to all the founders of the world as we know it: good or bad, let's drink to them all!
