# Title: Aberidus

The simple, yet ingenious, technology that revolutionized the economy of the late 8th decade society, the aberidus was developed by an unknown inventor. Scholars will likely debate this point for many years to come, giving credit to various figures, but the fact remains that there is not enough evidence to yield an answer. Origin means little compared to the impact though. The clever contraption both eased manual labor and drastically increased ennui by allowing workers to, simply put, stop working. This of course led to the tragic existentialist disaster known as [[The Year of the Waiting]] and they were subsequently outlawed.

The research into weaponizing such existential tragedy of course came to the forefront of the [[Vineman Convention]] research, and the impact of such rampant absurdity on global affairs sent international politics in a tailspin that would have likely ended in war if everybody hadn't lost all interest in everything.
