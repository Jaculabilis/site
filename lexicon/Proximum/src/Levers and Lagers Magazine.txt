# Title: Levers and Lagers: A Fond Farewell

It has been an honor to serve as editor in chief of Levers and Lagers since it's foundation in the 9th decade of our return to the Near Side.  Now that our society faces graver dangers than it ever has since [[the Year of the Waiting]], which only a few of us old codgers still remember, it is more important than ever to share a beer with friends and mock the demons that bedevil our society!

To stave off the effects of [[Aberidus]] Tremens, I am enjoying an IIPA at the [[Magic Lever Brewery and Replete Pub]] with its founder, my old comrade Ibrahim Reed.  Ah yes: thick tan head, light amber color, medium body, hints of caramel, honey and toasted bread; a bit of pine like an evergreen forest of Earth; strong bitterness like horehound candy;  a touch of tartness (lactobacillus?); maybe something like coriander: a nexus of everything good where all contrasts are harmonized.  Our civilization and our own selves also need harmony.

The best way to truly understand and overcome the differences between the Nearside, and Deep Thingness, to traverse the [[Pendulous Passage]] through False Thingness to Realitas Vera, is to sacrifice, not just a cherished gift, not just secrets, not just memories but everything!  And what better way than through the ancient alchemy of Barley and Hops and Yeast!  Why, under the inspiration of Bacchus, does a man give away a gift; does he tell a secret?  Why, he gives away generously everywhere to everyone!  He tells all secrets; he forgets all things!  What more could he give than his very senses, than consciousness, that great myssery?  This is where the lojic of the Tractatuses failes!  This is what Yaner, beautiful Yaner, once behelde.
