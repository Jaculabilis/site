# Title: False Reality

**False Reality** is the old title for the Nearside's counterpoint plane, more commonly 
known today (because of the provenance of fools) as the True Reality.  It is a hideous 
realm that grows more hideous by the hour as the [[Ignis Ignotus]]-warped Pyroxenes 
reshape it in their twisted image to better channel mochlomantic energy.

According to [[experts on the matter|Mochlomancy]], [[Yanner's Inversion]] was intended 
to avert an incoming catastrophe by momentarily splitting reality along metaphysical lines: 
the False Reality, where all that would be would not be, and the Nearside, where all that 
could be could come to be.  Hence the traditional names: the False Reality was a place 
of stagnation and eventual nonbeing, and the Nearside was near to a limitless number of 
possibilities—including, one must sadly concede, a nest of self-important [[vipers|Key and Lock Principle]] 
who would unfairly claim a scholar's death before solving a theory as proof of his incompetence.

Of those vipers, there are none more venomous than [[Shahan Fuizhen]], architect of the 
//Atlas Arcanum//, who—in the face of the Pyroxenes' establishment of the Replete Dominion—
decided to rename that cesspit of death and decay to "True Reality" in the face of 
widespread opposition even within the Scholarium.  Dr. Fuizhen, whose clique has maintained 
political advantage within the Scholarium since the late fourth cycle, has become 
increasingly unable to hide the fact that he has used necromantic energies to prolong his 
wretched life.  Though he continues to insist his unnatural lifespan of 180 years is only 
due to healthy living, he is currently under investigation by the Semiheresy for possessing 
artifacts used in connection with a Pyroxene necromantic ritual murder.  
Indeed, many who have spoken with him in person have reported that, in private, he has 
been known to say that the [[Doglords Imperious]] were wrong to try to institute the 
[[Hollow Dominion]] in False Reality and allow it to settle to tranquil nothingness once more.  

It is a great injustice that Dr. Fuizhen remains a Scholarium member in good standing, but 
all members who speak out against him—myself included—have coincidentally lost their positions.
