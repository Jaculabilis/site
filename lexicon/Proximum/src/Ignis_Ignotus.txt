Originally thought to be a novel form of energy, **Ignis Ignotus** was discovered by Nearside scientists as an encroaching substance breaking into True Reality. It was acknowledged that this matter was expanding and would likely not cease in this. In the hopes of harnessing a potential [[secondary bivalence|Bivalence Genera]] of True Reality, a project was commissioned to harness this new substance. The dangers of this were only somewhat known, and the Nexus metaphysicists made some grave miscalculations. The cost was high. The backblast sent ripples through the very fabric of reality, and thus the modern phenomenon of **Ignis Ignotus** was born. 

Regardless, Ignis Ignotusâ€™ corrupting effects soon spread throughout the Nearside, giving birth to the Pyroxenes. Well known is the history afterwards. The Pyroxenes gained support (see [[Pyroxene Sympathizers]]), and many continued to foolishly experiment with this foul material. The Replete Dominion arrival really was only a matter of time after this. The [[GCVS|Gravitational Containment and Vacuum Sealing]] is reliable for now. But with the Pyroxenes gaining more support, popular sentiment is, as Robert Earthson has catalogued, started to consider turning them off, which would surely spell disaster. The [[Lesser Incursion]] was a result of such considerations, and one would think that this would have put a stop to such nonsense. 

Were it not for this corrupting substance, we quite possibly would not have experienced the horrors of the 6th and 7th decades.
