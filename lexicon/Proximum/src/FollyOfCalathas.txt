# Title: Folly of Calathas, The

Many are the inhumane deeds of [[Calathas the Unholy]], the brutal and bloody tyrant whose name is synonymous with wickedness and bad hygiene. However, little is known about the rise and fall of this villain of history, that is, little was known until the discovery of a seven thousand page section in the [[Parcum Protomythos]] labeled **The Folly of Calathas**. It is no surprise this has section was missed, as it of course only accounts for less than one tenth of a percent of the overall content. 

**The Folly of Calathas** is, like most sections in the Parcum Protomythos, unknown in author and origin. But it does describe Calathas as humble of origin, recruited by the Pyroxenes as a young child. His power grew as he ascended the ranks, finally becoming the first to be adopted into the Pyroxenes themselves. 

Of course, it is well known of his ability to travel effortlessly through the [[Pendulous Passage]], and scholars continue to debate the nature of his ability to do so. The answer, however, is obvious that it lies in his brilliant insight into the Passage's system, understanding that memory is indeed a matter of personal significance. Though some claim it impossible to do so by citing rubbish texts, there is no definitive case to be made for this rebuttal, and any such lofty claim should be considered with the highest of skepticism. His Folly, the text of the Parcum Protomythos indicates, is in fact his willingness to sacrifice even the most precious memory for the cause of the Pyroxenes, therefore there is precedent for such a claim. But I suppose Duke Strato Merovalitus //finally// stumbled into truth when he said that "basic theoretical competency is far too much to expect."
