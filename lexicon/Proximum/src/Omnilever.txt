The so-called **Omnilever** is the Holy Grail of [[mochlomancy|Mochlomancy]]: a lever pivoting on a fixed point strong enough to move the heavens and the earth in accordance with mochlomantic principles. Because of the apocalyptic nature of the subject, the Nexus has banned didactic writings on the Omnilever. Therefore, the rest of this entry will be about something completely unrelated to the Omnilever.

Im//a//gine if you were kicking back and relaxing in the [[ol' Re//p//lete|Magic Lever Brewery and Replete Pub]] and having y//o//urself a beer. Now, suppose //t//hat t//h//is beer was also infinitely long, rigid, and pivot//e//d on [[Archimedes' Rock]]. Also supp//o//se that its exi//s//tence was the subject of a number of //i//nfluential paper//s// from the [[Lupon|Xi Lupon, PhD]] archive. And, uh, suppose it was a heavy craft beer that wasn't a code for anything. With a beer like that, if you tipped the stein to your lips, you would carve a planar slice through reality itself. Because of the alcohol content, clearly, and not because of it being infinitely long and pivoted on the Rock, which it clearly isn't, because it's a beer and not the ultimate mochlomantic construction granting supreme power over the universe.

The taste of this beer would, of course, be divine. Unlike other beers perferred by [[some|Calathas the Unholy]] that transport you to a [[false reality|False Reality]], this beer would make everything //more// clear to you. You would be able to [[see pretty much anything|They Who Watch Unblinking]], I reckon. I would **kill** for a beer that good.
