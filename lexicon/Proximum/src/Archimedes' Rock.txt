# Title: Archimedes' Rock

**Archimedes' Rock** is a fundamental theoretical concept in the field of [[Mochlomancy]].  
According to the [[Tractatus Logico-Thaumaturgus]]—the foundational text of the field 
(even if the wig-addled publication addicts at the Scholarium feign to have transcended it, 
all but the most hopeless of them acknowledge its indispensable function as a starting point)—
Archimedes' Rock is a locus of stability required for any mochlomantic action.

However, we owe the majority of our knowledge of Archimedes' Rock to a particular figure  
in the field, Robert Earthson.  Indeed, it it hardly possible to talk of one without 
encountering the other.  Earthson is a rather dramatic character: he was born on 
Earth before the [[Inversion|Yanner's Inversion]] warped it into the Nearside, and 
witnessed the establishment of the [[Doglords|Doglords Imperious]]' reign.  In the midst 
of that time of chaos and upheaval, and witnessing the rise of the wicked Pyroxenes and 
their insatiable hunger for conquest and consumption, Earthson knew that a time would come 
when humanity would forget the knowledge he possessed.  Heroically, he did not return to 
the Nearside for five seasonal cycles—a span of about two and a half years for him, and 
a thousand years for the rest of humanity.  With the Pyroxenes' establishment of the 
Replete Dominion at the beginning of the current cycle, he returned to share his horde 
of mochlomantic lore.

Alone among mochlomantic practitioners, Earthson claims to have seen Archimedes' Rock in 
person.  For this he is mocked by vainglorious members of the Scholarium, who have convinced 
themselves that their personal failures to find the Rock prove that it was a metaphor all 
along, and who unconvincingly hide their jealousy by making juvenile quips about Earthson's 
noted expertise on non-Euclidean beers.

With the cycle's end approaching, and with it humanity's expulsion into the territory now 
controlled by the Replete Dominion, it has become more imperative than ever that we take 
up the banner of this humble hero, and help him build his [[Omnilever]] upon Archimedes' Rock.
