# Title: The Year of the Waiting

As I escape from the dungeons of the Semiheresy with my rescuer, the incomparable Robert 
Earthson, and former and present colleague Dr. Ronson, I find myself reflecting on ancient 
puzzles.

I ask myself, what is the worth of a man?  Surely not an unfamiliar question to those of 
us who survived the **Year of the Waiting**, watching as the Template Machines of the 
[[Aberidus]] produced endless copies of ourselves—our selves—but stronger, smarter, //better//, 
even as the [[semiheresy|The Indomitable Semiheresy]] assured us they were leverless, 
demonstrably without souls.  Who among us could fail to fall into listlessness, seeing our 
dearest dreams and wishes fulfilled by the gods we might have been?  What is it about our 
leveredness that binds us to this fractured and absurd world?  And who could blame us for 
waiting for some hero to appear and hand us an answer?

I asked myself because I first asked myself, why are there five [[bivalence genera|Bivalence Genera]]?  
The [[//Tractatus//|Tractatus Logico-Thaumaturgus]] predicts an even number, reasoning from 
the Principle of Balance.  But, noticing my confusion, Earthson told me that there has always 
been a sixth: //mochlontic bivalence//, the phenomenon of leveredness or unleveredness.  
And his answer suddenly made a great deal clear to me, for I was asking these questions as 
Dr. Ronson and I perused the confidential files Earthson casually stole on our way out of 
the Partial Vatican.  According to him, it was why he allowed himself to be arrested in 
the first place.

And so now I ask myself, how did the Pyroxenes effect the Replete Dominion in the face of 
Nexus efforts?

For the Pyroxenes and the [[Doglords Imperious]] were both of unleveredness, and left alone 
should have struggled fruitlessly for eternity.  But our levered existence tipped the balance—
and should have ended the struggle in the Doglords' favor, but in truth the opposite occurred.  
How?

The answer, as these documents reveal, is none other than the Semiheresy itself.  Their 
agents sabotaged the work of long-dead researchers to result in the creation of [[Ignis Ignotus]],
that which saps the leveredness from the world.  With the Doglords dead, they mean to assume 
full control of humanity.  What is the worth of humanity?  There is a weight to our existence, 
a weight born of struggle and striving, of the pursuit of value, that Pyroxene agents nearly 
succeeded in extinguishing with the Year of the Waiting.  Why?  Why is our existence significant?

And then I understand, at last I understand, why the Semiheresy has banned research on the 
[[Omnilever]]: there is no Omnilever.

//We// are the Omnilever.

The three of us have gone into hiding, but the day is coming when we will return.  Hear 
these words and remember: the cycle's end approaches, and this time //we will win.//
