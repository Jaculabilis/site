# Title: Pendulous Passage

Between our beautiful paradise of the Nearside and the bitter disorganization of the 
horrifically-named True Reality (N.B. that it is my constant lament and frustration that 
modern necromancy's reach remains insufficient to summon the rotten soul of that wretch 
Shahang Fuizhen and berate him for his wholly unsatisfactory choice of names; damn him, 
damn his buffoonish Explorer Society, and damn the featherbrained blunderers at the 
Scholarium who enshrined his folly in the //Atlas Arcanum//) is a harrowing pathway known 
as the **Pendulous Passage**.

As the Nearside and the True Reality are separated by a stretch of primordial chaos, 
the Passage weaves a tumultuous route from one to the other; the roiling environment 
and the restive movements of the Passage itself give rise to the feeling, universally 
remarked upon by travelers, that the firmament itself is rocking back and forthâ€”hence 
the eponymous pendulousity of the Passage.  Passage through the Passage is not free: 
travelers are unable to set foot upon it unless they sacrifice something of personal 
significance, with examples ranging from childhood trinkets, to secrets, to gifts from 
a cherished friend. 

Recently, a gaggle of cretins from the Scholarium have begun hawking a laughable theory 
that a traveler could gain passage by the sacrifice of a memory, which they use to 
explain [[Calathas the Unholy]]'s apparently unlimited power of traversal.  This theory is 
pure hogwash, of course, as anyone who has read the //[[Tractatus Logico-Thaumaturgus]]// can 
attest.  But of course basic theoretical competency is far too much to expect from that 
league of loons.
