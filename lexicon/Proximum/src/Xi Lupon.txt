# Title: Xi Lupon, PhD

The only member of the Explorer Society to contribute something of worth to civilization, 
**Xi Lupon** was an archaeologist and literary historian most notable for his work on 
the [[Parcum Protomythos]].  Lupon completed his doctoral thesis at the Scholarium on the 
Protomythos's mythic elements, and how one might discriminate between the historical 
reality and the fanciful elements that were added later.  His thesis so impressed high-
level Nexus officials that they allowed him to remain in the Nearside during the [[Fourth Season]], 
an honor that has only been awarded to seven other humans at the time of writing.

Since Nearside seasons last for fifty years within the Nearside but six weeks outside of 
it, humanity returned to find Dr. Lupon an old man.  In humanity's absence, he had been 
granted access to classified Nexus records of the events that formed the core of the myths 
in the Protomythos.  Although many details were classified beyond his security clearance—
and consequently remain a matter of scholarly debate—Dr. Lupon's research conclusively 
settled several open questions, such as the fact that [[Archpraetor Fikrilin //deg// Yanner|Yanner's Inversion]] 
actually existed.

Dr. Lupon's magnum opus, however, was a monograph on the [[Folly of Calathas|Folly of Calathas, The]] 
in which he revealed that the eponymous necromantic tyrant was well known by his 
contemporaries for being constantly blackout drunk.  He argued from primary sources that 
this detail was corrupted by the passage of time into the legend that is told today by 
children and third-rate members of the Scholarium, an argument which has been further developed 
by [[contemporary scholars|Levers and Lagers: A Fond Farewell]].  But because Lupon's 
argument would have invalidated the work of certain politically-connected members of the 
Scholarium, his groundbreaking research received little to no attention, and consequently 
the discredited (and mochlomantically impossible) interpretation of the //Folly// is held 
by some "scholars" to this day.

After his death in the third decade, the Scholarium rectified their grievous error and 
instituted the Lupon Award for Scholarly Excellence in his honor.
