If you've ever been at the [[Magic Lever|Magic Lever Brewery and Replete Pub]] during Cheerful Chrononce, undoubtedly you have heard the tales told in drinking songs of those legends, the **Jurist-Knights** of the Nearside. Those brave lawyers who quested in search of adventure, glory, and litigation are some of the most beloved heroes in our contemporary popular imagination. By night, they rode to defend the weak and dispossessed; by day, they plied their trade in the courtrooms.

The most well-known ballad of the Jurist-Knights these days must be the insidiously catchy "Ain't No //Habeas Corpus// in Hell", which tells of the Jurist-Knights' history with [[Calathas the Unholy]]. The song recounts Calathas' apprenticeship with one Sir Calvin; his expulsion from the Jurist-Knights after his [[Pyroxene recruitment|Folly of Calathas, The]]; his deadly revenge on Sir Calvin; and the fated final battle between Sir Jameson, Calathas' fellow apprentice under Sir Calvin, and the ascended Pyroxene Calathas. With the assistance of a citizen jury, Sir Jameson unleashed a lawsuit so powerful that it left both of them crippled by legal fees, leaving Calathas vulnerable for just long enough for Jameson to tackle him through the [[Passage|Pendulous Passage]], whence neither were seen again.

The powerful urge of the Jurist-Knights to defend the lowest among us led to their tragic end when they promulgated the [[Zymurgy Sanctions]] comdemning the Template Machines as massive human rights violations. Though many believed that the courage and resolve of the Jurist-Knights would carry the day, none predicted the invention of the [[Aberidus]]. The weaponization of the aberidus turned the tide against the Jurist-Knights, and to this day we sing of their final and futile stand against extinction in that somber classic, "See You Space Lawyer".
