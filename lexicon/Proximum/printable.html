<h2>Aberidus</h2>
<p>The simple, yet ingenious, technology that revolutionized the economy of the late 8th decade society, the aberidus was developed by an unknown inventor. Scholars will likely debate this point for many years to come, giving credit to various figures, but the fact remains that there is not enough evidence to yield an answer. Origin means little compared to the impact though. The clever contraption both eased manual labor and drastically increased ennui by allowing workers to, simply put, stop working. This of course led to the tragic existentialist disaster known as The Year of the Waiting<sup>1</sup> and they were subsequently outlawed.</p></div>
<p>The research into weaponizing such existential tragedy of course came to the forefront of the Vineman Convention<sup>2</sup> research, and the impact of such rampant absurdity on global affairs sent international politics in a tailspin that would have likely ended in war if everybody hadn't lost all interest in everything.</p>

<h2>Gravitational Containment and Vacuum Sealing</h2>
<p>Together these form the only reliable method of halting the spread of Ignis Ignotus<sup>1</sup>
  and preserving the values and beauty of civilization for which the Near Side is known.  
While I can respect the Pyroxenes' decision to embrace Ignis Ignotus, it is because of the very irrevocability of it, 
and I think they are well aware of this, if they are aware of anything anymore.  
It is a wondrous and awe inspiring leap into the unknown, but we cannot afford to risk 
everything we have brought with us to the Near Side.  So complete separation by vacuums and reverse gravity fields 
are the only viable option until science progresses to another age.  
The fond hope of many Pyroxene Sympathizers<sup>2</sup> is that the Replete Dominion itself will bring about a rapid
positive change if only we would turn off the energy fields.  If they wish to do so individually, I respect them, 
but collectively, we must keep up gravitational containment and vacuum sealing.</p></div>

<h2>Pendulous Passage</h2>
<p>Between our beautiful paradise of the Nearside and the bitter disorganization of the 
horrifically-named True Reality (N.B. that it is my constant lament and frustration that 
modern necromancy's reach remains insufficient to summon the rotten soul of that wretch 
Shahang Fuizhen and berate him for his wholly unsatisfactory choice of names; damn him, 
damn his buffoonish Explorer Society, and damn the featherbrained blunderers at the 
Scholarium who enshrined his folly in the <i>Atlas Arcanum</i>) is a harrowing pathway known 
as the <b>Pendulous Passage</b>.</p></div>
<p>As the Nearside and the True Reality are separated by a stretch of primordial chaos, 
the Passage weaves a tumultuous route from one to the other; the roiling environment 
and the restive movements of the Passage itself give rise to the feeling, universally 
remarked upon by travelers, that the firmament itself is rocking back and forthâ€”hence 
the eponymous pendulousity of the Passage.  Passage through the Passage is not free: 
travelers are unable to set foot upon it unless they sacrifice something of personal 
significance, with examples ranging from childhood trinkets, to secrets, to gifts from 
a cherished friend. </p>
<p>Recently, a gaggle of cretins from the Scholarium have begun hawking a laughable theory 
that a traveler could gain passage by the sacrifice of a memory, which they use to 
explain Calathas the Unholy<sup>1</sup>'s apparently unlimited power of traversal.  This theory is 
pure hogwash, of course, as anyone who has read the <i>Tractatus Logico-Thaumaturgus<sup>2</sup></i> can 
attest.  But of course basic theoretical competency is far too much to expect from that 
league of loons.  </p>

<h2>Yanner's Inversion</h2>
<p>Because scholarly attention on the Parcum Protomythos<sup>1</sup> has, as of late, focused on textual reconstruction, insufficient attention has been paid to the <i>content</i> of the texts. Of those guiding legends of the Nearside, few rival the influence of <b>Yanner's Inversion</b>. As the mythic <i>explanans</i> of the mochlomantic climate that allowed the emergence of the Pyroxenes, it is centrally placed in understanding Nearside heritage.</p></div>
<p>The Inversion was the magnum opus of the Archpraetor Fikrilin <i>deg</i> Yanner. In order to avert or sidestep an impending disaster -- there are a number of theories and oral traditions as to what this disaster was -- Yanner spent a year and a day preparing a world-shaping spell of mochlomancy<sup>2</sup>, the magic of levers. With the disaster imminent, Yanner unleashed a storm of arcane power that reversed the Nearside with its opposite. Because of her characteristic disregard for safety measures, however, the containment runes had been hastily sketched at only six lennings, and a breach resulted in a catastrophic containment failure. The spell was accidentally multicast several times, thrashing the Nearside back and forth seven times in the space of a chrononce. Per the legends, the mochlomantic reverberations unleashed by this event are the origin of the current destabilized mochlomantic climate.</p>
<p>Scholarly debate on the veracity of the Inversion centers around the possibility of Yanner's alleged spell, as necessary details to replicate it have been lost. While several prominent mochlomancers have stated that the legendary effects of the spell are impossible to replicate with any conceivable mochlomancy, dissension with this opinion has grown owing to theories that Yanner's spell fundamentally altered the mochlomantic background of the Nearside, making a repeat performance impossible.</p>

<h2>Bivalence Genera</h2>
<p>Theoretical research in the Scholarium has uncovered, frustratingly, <i>five</i> bivalent phenomena underlying the Nearside's metaphysical ecology. Collectively, they are called the <b>bivalence genera</b>:</p></div>
<p><i>Semiside bivalance</i> is, of course, the existence of both our Nearside and the True Reality (also called the Turnways Reality). This is sometimes called the <i>primary bivalence</i> or <i>master bivalence</i>, since the other bivalences have only been found within the Nearside [1].</p>
<p><i>Gravitational bivalence</i> is the phenomenon where those who are born in the Nearside have, with roughly equal chance, one of two gravitational alignments: either "in" towards the Nearside, or "out" away from it. While living with out-valence was possible before if one was careful, the development of gravitational technology<sup>1</sup> has greatly reduced the mortality rate for out-valents.</p>
<p><i>Radial bivalence</i>, also known as <i>blink bivalence</i>, is the phenomenon across the inner and outer sides of the the Nearside torus. While we live on the outer side, the inner side is inhabited by the inside-out ones, They Who Watch Unblinking<sup>2</sup>, who look unceasingly to the center.</p>
<p>The final and most problematic bivalence is <i>season bivalence</i>, which has frustrated Scholarium researchers for decades. There are, as we all learned in school, three seasons in the Nearside: scintillate, jazzy, and negative. However, after researchers failed to reduce one of the seasons to a linear combination of the others, it was discovered that the seasons are actually a double bivalence, with the unknown fourth season<sup>3</sup> having been banned by the Nexus. This has stymied all subsequent attempts to systematize the bivalence genera.</p>
<hr><span class="signature"><p> Sneezeguard Jones, Nearside semiheretic</p></span>
<p>[1] Research efforts to discover secondary bivalences in True Reality are, of course, never sanctioned for safety reasons.</p>

<h2>Folly of Calathas, The</h2>
<p>Many are the inhumane deeds of Calathas the Unholy<sup>1</sup>, the brutal and bloody tyrant whose name is synonymous with wickedness and bad hygiene. However, little is known about the rise and fall of this villain of history, that is, little was known until the discovery of a seven thousand page section in the Parcum Protomythos<sup>2</sup> labeled <b>The Folly of Calathas</b>. It is no surprise this has section was missed, as it of course only accounts for less than one tenth of a percent of the overall content. </p></div>
<p><b>The Folly of Calathas</b> is, like most sections in the Parcum Protomythos, unknown in author and origin. But it does describe Calathas as humble of origin, recruited by the Pyroxenes as a young child. His power grew as he ascended the ranks, finally becoming the first to be adopted into the Pyroxenes themselves. </p>
<p>Of course, it is well known of his ability to travel effortlessly through the Pendulous Passage<sup>3</sup>, and scholars continue to debate the nature of his ability to do so. The answer, however, is obvious that it lies in his brilliant insight into the Passage's system, understanding that memory is indeed a matter of personal significance. Though some claim it impossible to do so by citing rubbish texts, there is no definitive case to be made for this rebuttal, and any such lofty claim should be considered with the highest of skepticism. His Folly, the text of the Parcum Protomythos indicates, is in fact his willingness to sacrifice even the most precious memory for the cause of the Pyroxenes, therefore there is precedent for such a claim. But I suppose Duke Strato Merovalitus <i>finally</i> stumbled into truth when he said that "basic theoretical competency is far too much to expect."</p>

<h2>Levers and Lagers: A Fond Farewell</h2>
<p>It has been an honor to serve as editor in chief of Levers and Lagers since it's foundation in the 9th decade of our return to the Near Side.  Now that our society faces graver dangers than it ever has since the Year of the Waiting<sup>1</sup>, which only a few of us old codgers still remember, it is more important than ever to share a beer with friends and mock the demons that bedevil our society!</p></div>
<p>To stave off the effects of Aberidus<sup>2</sup> Tremens, I am enjoying an IIPA at the Magic Lever Brewery and Replete Pub<sup>3</sup> with its founder, my old comrade Ibrahim Reed.  Ah yes: thick tan head, light amber color, medium body, hints of caramel, honey and toasted bread; a bit of pine like an evergreen forest of Earth; strong bitterness like horehound candy;  a touch of tartness (lactobacillus?); maybe something like coriander: a nexus of everything good where all contrasts are harmonized.  Our civilization and our own selves also need harmony.</p>
<p>The best way to truly understand and overcome the differences between the Nearside, and Deep Thingness, to traverse the Pendulous Passage<sup>4</sup> through False Thingness to Realitas Vera, is to sacrifice, not just a cherished gift, not just secrets, not just memories but everything!  And what better way than through the ancient alchemy of Barley and Hops and Yeast!  Why, under the inspiration of Bacchus, does a man give away a gift; does he tell a secret?  Why, he gives away generously everywhere to everyone!  He tells all secrets; he forgets all things!  What more could he give than his very senses, than consciousness, that great myssery?  This is where the lojic of the Tractatuses failes!  This is what Yaner, beautiful Yaner, once behelde.</p>

<h2>Vineman Convention</h2>
<p>The <b>Vineman Convention</b> was a rule of resource allocation first set forth by the 
inimitable Kelly Vineman, the first Head Researcher appointed after the establishment of 
the Nexus outpost in the Nearside.</p></div>
<p>In the disastrous wake of Yanner's Inversion<sup>1</sup>, Nexus arcanostrategists decided a more 
proactive approach to cataclysm prevention was needed.  This decision was handed down to 
the heads of each division to execute as they saw fit, as per Nexus custom.  Vineman's 
response was to institute the Vineman Convention, which simply ran: "Assign funding 
priority to projects combating existential threats."  Her hope was that teams of people, 
working in advance of the actual threat, could provide enough leeway to prevent 
unnecessary mistakes like those resulting from Yanner's bungling.  For this reason, the 
Convention became informally known as the "Seventh Lenning."</p>
<p>Ironically, the first wave of Vineman Convention projects were aimed at controverting the 
aftereffects of the Inversion itself.  Researchers gradually became aware that the 
ontological trauma sustained by the Nearside during the inversion allowed for trace 
amounts of the substance we now know as Ignis Ignotus<sup>2</sup> to seep into the plane.  
Exposure to Ignis Ignotus had a morphogenic effect on the Nearside's natives, a process 
we now know results in a complete and irrevocable transformation into the cruel and 
sinister Pyroxenes.  This period of research culminated in the development of the 
GCVS systems<sup>3</sup> that maintain Nexus space 
in the Nearside to this day, dividing our exquisite home from the eldritch horrors beyond 
the energy shields.  Environmental reclamation efforts were underway for some time, but 
were indefinitely suspended after the Lesser Incursion<sup>4</sup>.</p>
<p>With the completion of the GCVS systems, the Vineman Convention became little more than 
a historical curiosity until some utter imbecile at the Scholarium officially declared 
the aberidus<sup>5</sup> an existential threat. The resulting reallocation of resources 
unnecessarily crippled many promising projects and ruined several careers, all because 
that addled, senile <i>idiot</i> couldn't resist a pun.</p>

<h2>Doglords Imperious</h2>
<p>Hail, great canines! In their name I dedicate this Lexicon to the <b>Doglords Imperious</b>, those august and wise powers that be whose Nexus so benevolently sustains us. Yea, the Doglords who have ruled the Nearside from time immemorial graced we humble pilgrims with the means to survive in the Nearside in our hour of need, and still today we live by their decrees.</p></div>
<p>Indeed, we owe to them our greatest scholarly achievements. I hardly dare to begin enumerating their benefits, lest I shall never cease, but 'twas by their charity that we were allowed to discover among the papers they used for bedding and waste the fragments of the Protomythos<sup>1</sup>. Only through the patronage of Sparky the Inviolable did Vineman<sup>2</sup> produce such fruit as the GCVS systems, for which our researchers were rewarded with a second donation of Protomythos pages, this time only slightly soiled. It was these seven thousand pages, each enscribed with a single, illuminated letter, which we were able to rearrange into the <i>Folly of Calathas</i><sup>3</sup>. Remember, ye Nearsiders: remember the debt ye owe to the Doglords.</p>
<p>Stray not from the path they have set. Fie, fie, I say, fie upon those who would resist their doctrines! May the accursed Pyroxenes rue the day that they dared to oppose their designs to the Hollow Dominion<sup>4</sup> of the Doglords Imperious, whose barks ring everlasting!</p>

<h2>Ignis Ignotus</h2>
<p>Originally thought to be a novel form of energy, <b>Ignis Ignotus</b> was discovered by Nearside scientists as an encroaching substance breaking into True Reality. It was acknowledged that this matter was expanding and would likely not cease in this. In the hopes of harnessing a potential secondary bivalence<sup>1</sup> of True Reality, a project was commissioned to harness this new substance. The dangers of this were only somewhat known, and the Nexus metaphysicists made some grave miscalculations. The cost was high. The backblast sent ripples through the very fabric of reality, and thus the modern phenomenon of <b>Ignis Ignotus</b> was born. </p></div>
<p>Regardless, Ignis Ignotusâ€™ corrupting effects soon spread throughout the Nearside, giving birth to the Pyroxenes. Well known is the history afterwards. The Pyroxenes gained support (see Pyroxene Sympathizers<sup>2</sup>), and many continued to foolishly experiment with this foul material. The Replete Dominion arrival really was only a matter of time after this. The GCVS<sup>3</sup> is reliable for now. But with the Pyroxenes gaining more support, popular sentiment is, as Robert Earthson has catalogued, started to consider turning them off, which would surely spell disaster. The Lesser Incursion<sup>4</sup> was a result of such considerations, and one would think that this would have put a stop to such nonsense. </p>
<p>Were it not for this corrupting substance, we quite possibly would not have experienced the horrors of the 6th and 7th decades.</p>

<h2>Mochlomancy</h2>
<p>I would like to rant more about the Vine-Man's<sup>1</sup> closure of the Fourth Season Bar for an illegal performance of Vivaldi.  But really, the role of zymourgists in the Nexus is to promote brotherly comradery against the real enemy, and with Origin Day approaching this jazzy time of year is a good one for historical reflection through the golden, forgiving glow of a good Belgian Trivalence<sup>2</sup>.</p></div>
<p>It's hard to believe, but long ago, before Yanner<sup>3</sup> turned Earth into a three dimensional sphere pasted over a four dimensional torus, when half of all plants and animals started to up-gravitate and it required a PhD in Topology to find the nearest pub for years until they got GPS to work again, mochlomancy was not a household name.  (Yes I know, some people claim that Yanner's spell was impossible, but something turned our planet into a hyper-doughnut whose inner half (which used to be Australia, Brazil and Michigan) is now full of beings that gaze towards a center in the fourth dimension<sup>4</sup>, and that something was Yanner!)  Before the Archpraetor's day, mochlomancy was a small obscure movement of particle physicists, Feng Shui experts and conventional thaumaturges searching for Archimedes' Rock<sup>5</sup> after the failure of cold fusion in solving the energy crisis of those days. </p>
<p>Now, it is ubiquitous.  Everything from the proper design of taproom levers, to incantations for the stabilization of quark stars to the Kupakamasutra is based on mochlomantic principles.  So here's to Yanner; here's to Shahan Fuizhen<sup>6</sup>; here's to all the founders of the world as we know it: good or bad, let's drink to them all!</p>

<h2>Xi Lupon, PhD</h2>
<p>The only member of the Explorer Society to contribute something of worth to civilization, 
<b>Xi Lupon</b> was an archaeologist and literary historian most notable for his work on 
the Parcum Protomythos<sup>1</sup>.  Lupon completed his doctoral thesis at the Scholarium on the 
Protomythos's mythic elements, and how one might discriminate between the historical 
reality and the fanciful elements that were added later.  His thesis so impressed high-
level Nexus officials that they allowed him to remain in the Nearside during the Fourth Season<sup>2</sup>, 
an honor that has only been awarded to seven other humans at the time of writing.</p></div>
<p>Since Nearside seasons last for fifty years within the Nearside but six weeks outside of 
it, humanity returned to find Dr. Lupon an old man.  In humanity's absence, he had been 
granted access to classified Nexus records of the events that formed the core of the myths 
in the Protomythos.  Although many details were classified beyond his security clearanceâ€”
and consequently remain a matter of scholarly debateâ€”Dr. Lupon's research conclusively 
settled several open questions, such as the fact that Archpraetor Fikrilin <i>deg</i> Yanner<sup>3</sup> 
actually existed.</p>
<p>Dr. Lupon's magnum opus, however, was a monograph on the Folly of Calathas<sup>4</sup> 
in which he revealed that the eponymous necromantic tyrant was well known by his 
contemporaries for being constantly blackout drunk.  He argued from primary sources that 
this detail was corrupted by the passage of time into the legend that is told today by 
children and third-rate members of the Scholarium, an argument which has been further developed 
by contemporary scholars<sup>5</sup>.  But because Lupon's 
argument would have invalidated the work of certain politically-connected members of the 
Scholarium, his groundbreaking research received little to no attention, and consequently 
the discredited (and mochlomantically impossible) interpretation of the <i>Folly</i> is held 
by some "scholars" to this day.</p>
<p>After his death in the third decade, the Scholarium rectified their grievous error and 
instituted the Lupon Award for Scholarly Excellence in his honor.</p>

<h2>Archimedes' Rock</h2>
<p><b>Archimedes' Rock</b> is a fundamental theoretical concept in the field of Mochlomancy<sup>1</sup>.  
According to the Tractatus Logico-Thaumaturgus<sup>2</sup>â€”the foundational text of the field 
(even if the wig-addled publication addicts at the Scholarium feign to have transcended it, 
all but the most hopeless of them acknowledge its indispensable function as a starting point)â€”
Archimedes' Rock is a locus of stability required for any mochlomantic action.</p></div>
<p>However, we owe the majority of our knowledge of Archimedes' Rock to a particular figure  
in the field, Robert Earthson.  Indeed, it it hardly possible to talk of one without 
encountering the other.  Earthson is a rather dramatic character: he was born on 
Earth before the Inversion<sup>3</sup> warped it into the Nearside, and 
witnessed the establishment of the Doglords<sup>4</sup>' reign.  In the midst 
of that time of chaos and upheaval, and witnessing the rise of the wicked Pyroxenes and 
their insatiable hunger for conquest and consumption, Earthson knew that a time would come 
when humanity would forget the knowledge he possessed.  Heroically, he did not return to 
the Nearside for five seasonal cyclesâ€”a span of about two and a half years for him, and 
a thousand years for the rest of humanity.  With the Pyroxenes' establishment of the 
Replete Dominion at the beginning of the current cycle, he returned to share his horde 
of mochlomantic lore.</p>
<p>Alone among mochlomantic practitioners, Earthson claims to have seen Archimedes' Rock in 
person.  For this he is mocked by vainglorious members of the Scholarium, who have convinced 
themselves that their personal failures to find the Rock prove that it was a metaphor all 
along, and who unconvincingly hide their jealousy by making juvenile quips about Earthson's 
noted expertise on non-Euclidean beers.</p>
<p>With the cycle's end approaching, and with it humanity's expulsion into the territory now 
controlled by the Replete Dominion, it has become more imperative than ever that we take 
up the banner of this humble hero, and help him build his Omnilever<sup>5</sup> upon Archimedes' Rock.</p>

<h2>The Indomitable Semiheresy</h2>
<p>The history leading up to the founding of the <b>Indomitable Semiheresy</b> is well known: The people of Earth were stranded in True Reality by Yanner's reckless use of that cataclysmic art<sup>1</sup>. With the aid of the Nexus, most made it through the Pendulous Passage<sup>2</sup> back to Earth, now the Nearside. Research on Ignis Ignotus<sup>3</sup> turned the benign substance into an existential threat<sup>4</sup> and required the development of containment systems<sup>5</sup>. Yet these precautions were insufficient.</p></div>
<p>As the fourth season<sup>6</sup> approached, the Nexus bowed to necessity and established the Indomitable Semiheresy. The semiheretics were charged with evicting the residents of the Nearside at the end of negative until the beginning of scintillate. The name was given to evoke a sense of irrevocability about the <i>novus ordo</i> of the cycles and reflect the bittersweet task of its acolytes: though they were the shepherds of humanity, they did so by, for a season, exiling them from safety.</p>
<p>Historically, the Indomitable Semiheresy was given great doctrinal leeway by the Nexus. This became contentious in the last 10th decade when, following academic strife between the Semiheresy and the Scholarium, a previously-unpublished manuscript of the eminent Dr. Lupon<sup>7</sup> appeared on the desk of the head editor of Levers and Lagers<sup>8</sup>. The manuscript implicated several Half-Heresiarchs in a conspiracy to cause the experimental disaster that mutated Ignis Ignotus into the transmogrant it is today. The same manuscript also raised concerns that the Semiheresy was a viper's nest of undercover Pyroxene sympathizers<sup>9</sup>. This spawned a brief trend of calling it the Domitable Semiheresy, which wasn't funny the first time either, you <i>cretins</i>.</p>

<h2>Key and Lock Principle</h2>
<p>A groundbreaking theorem proven by noted metaphysicist Shahan Fuizhen<sup>1</sup>, the statement was postulated first by Xi Lupon<sup>2</sup> in the late 2nd decade, but only proven in the mid 4th decade. The statement itself is simple and as follows:</p></div>
<p><b>For every lock there must be a key, and for every key there must be a lock.</b></p>
<p>For all his repoire, Xi never was able to prove it, and in fact eventually came of the opinion that it was not true. When Dr. Fulzhen proved it five hours after reading about it, quite a few prestigious members of the Scholarium suggested striking Xi's name from Scholarium history for his incompetency, but his fame was still well revered, so it was decided to allow his good name, and even the award associated therein, persist. Evidently this lack of academic competency still lingers to this day, as there are some who still hold him as well revered in the metaphysicist community, and would rather cite him and resort to petty ad hominems than do actual research.</p>
<p>This principle is of great import for a number of reasons, the primary of which is that it guarantees the Pendulous Passage<sup>3</sup> to be ever accessible, no matter how well sealed. This is, of course, not to say that defense projects are hopeless, far from it. It is rather to encourage vigilance, as ever will persist the threat of incursion. Another fact that proceeds is that the Fourth Season<sup>4</sup> will be knowable and controllable given enough R&D, which I urge the Scholarium and Nexus to put more funding towards.</p>

<h2>Parcum Protomythos</h2>
<p>In some ways I prefer ancient history.  Linear time and linear space make things nice and straight forward.  Still our post-Yanner world has its perks.  After all, now that most of what remains of humanity is cornered in the Nearside, we get about two hundred minutes to slowly sip a beer or something stronger for each minute that the Pyroxenes get to grow in.  This gives you time to contemplate your fate and wonder if <i>they</i> will think of something.  Maybe our grandkids will know what to do.</p></div>
<p>Hopefully the Great Mastiffs<sup>1</sup> will still be around by then.  Let's be honest, we owe them a lot.  Space may be tight now, and they have no known economic value anymore, but if our species is going to cease to exist outside the realm of False Reality<sup>2</sup> then, even though the calculations are uncertain, I think we would have better deep leverage if we did not have dogblood on our hands.  Besides, given some of the prophetic hints in the Protomythos, we may yet need what is left of their minds.  Call me a Semiheretic if you like.</p>
<p>My friends have asked me to write an article about the <b>Parcum Protomythos</b>.  (Or rather, dared me to write about dog bedding.)  While many have questioned the Latin of the title, it is not an error, since there is no Magnus Protomythos.  It is "A Little Thing: The First Myth."  It was written as seven million ideograms on separate leafs of parchment.  Many of them are works of the highest calligraphy; some of them are hapax legomena whose meaning can only be guessed now.  Mochlomantic leverage in the deep realms near Archimedes' Rock<sup>3</sup> has revealed probable meanings for some, but others have baffled even the finest representatives of the Scholarium.</p>
<p>Even though it arose after Yanner's Inversion<sup>4</sup> due to the unstable warping of time, the Mastiffs' civilization is actually the longest lived on our planet, something like seven-thousand years of Pre-Yanner time, eclipsing ancient Egypt, its only human rival.  Since their glory days lasted only a few decades of human history and since they were already in severe decline by the time that Xi Lupon<sup>5</sup> inadvertently removed the grounding from their minds by learning the first sign of their language thus bringing human mochlomantic space into contact with their unlevered existence (and the fact that they always looked like dogs and now act like them) there is a strong tendency to treat them as mere animals. </p>
<p>The sad tendency of the Protomythos to regard us as divine or angelic beings also reinforces our very human prejudices.  Yet, if you can dig deeply, there is so much wisdom hidden there, so much depth, so much beauty, so much meaning upon meaning, layer upon layer, depth under depth, height upon height, it is like the perfect seven-thousand-year-old barley wine with unbelievable complexity and depth of flavor making everything produced by us look like a homebrewer's first attempt at a three-percent ale, not even a day out of the fermenter.</p>
<p>The contents, the contents of the First Myth, the most recent revelation in the World:   I don't think our languages can do justice to them.  Most of the scholarly controversies in this area boil down to the inadequacies of translation, and attempts to correlate the narratives with known events in our history.  The most famous passage of recent years is that which relates to the infamous necromancer Calathas the Unholy<sup>6</sup>.  It looks like it was actually a prophecy made three thousand years of their time before his baleful effects were felt in the Nearside, though intractable problems with our understanding of the language and chronology make this a disputed point and it is not known how they achieved this without levers.  I have too little space left here even to begin to outline all that can be said of surviving examples of origin tales, history and lunar poetry contained in the Protomythos.</p>
<p>If such flowers can blossom and perish in a day, what else could be hidden out there in the folds of our fragmented world?</p>

<h2>False Reality</h2>
<p><b>False Reality</b> is the old title for the Nearside's counterpoint plane, more commonly 
known today (because of the provenance of fools) as the True Reality.  It is a hideous 
realm that grows more hideous by the hour as the Ignis Ignotus<sup>1</sup>-warped Pyroxenes 
reshape it in their twisted image to better channel mochlomantic energy.</p></div>
<p>According to experts on the matter<sup>2</sup>, Yanner's Inversion<sup>3</sup> was intended 
to avert an incoming catastrophe by momentarily splitting reality along metaphysical lines: 
the False Reality, where all that would be would not be, and the Nearside, where all that 
could be could come to be.  Hence the traditional names: the False Reality was a place 
of stagnation and eventual nonbeing, and the Nearside was near to a limitless number of 
possibilitiesâ€”including, one must sadly concede, a nest of self-important vipers<sup>4</sup> 
who would unfairly claim a scholar's death before solving a theory as proof of his incompetence.</p>
<p>Of those vipers, there are none more venomous than Shahan Fuizhen<sup>5</sup>, architect of the 
<i>Atlas Arcanum</i>, whoâ€”in the face of the Pyroxenes' establishment of the Replete Dominionâ€”
decided to rename that cesspit of death and decay to "True Reality" in the face of 
widespread opposition even within the Scholarium.  Dr. Fuizhen, whose clique has maintained 
political advantage within the Scholarium since the late fourth cycle, has become 
increasingly unable to hide the fact that he has used necromantic energies to prolong his 
wretched life.  Though he continues to insist his unnatural lifespan of 180 years is only 
due to healthy living, he is currently under investigation by the Semiheresy for possessing 
artifacts used in connection with a Pyroxene necromantic ritual murder.  
Indeed, many who have spoken with him in person have reported that, in private, he has 
been known to say that the Doglords Imperious<sup>6</sup> were wrong to try to institute the 
Hollow Dominion<sup>7</sup> in False Reality and allow it to settle to tranquil nothingness once more.  </p>
<p>It is a great injustice that Dr. Fuizhen remains a Scholarium member in good standing, but 
all members who speak out against himâ€”myself includedâ€”have coincidentally lost their positions.</p>

<h2>Jurist-Knights</h2>
<p>If you've ever been at the Magic Lever<sup>1</sup> during Cheerful Chrononce, undoubtedly you have heard the tales told in drinking songs of those legends, the <b>Jurist-Knights</b> of the Nearside. Those brave lawyers who quested in search of adventure, glory, and litigation are some of the most beloved heroes in our contemporary popular imagination. By night, they rode to defend the weak and dispossessed; by day, they plied their trade in the courtrooms.</p></div>
<p>The most well-known ballad of the Jurist-Knights these days must be the insidiously catchy "Ain't No <i>Habeas Corpus</i> in Hell", which tells of the Jurist-Knights' history with Calathas the Unholy<sup>2</sup>. The song recounts Calathas' apprenticeship with one Sir Calvin; his expulsion from the Jurist-Knights after his Pyroxene recruitment<sup>3</sup>; his deadly revenge on Sir Calvin; and the fated final battle between Sir Jameson, Calathas' fellow apprentice under Sir Calvin, and the ascended Pyroxene Calathas. With the assistance of a citizen jury, Sir Jameson unleashed a lawsuit so powerful that it left both of them crippled by legal fees, leaving Calathas vulnerable for just long enough for Jameson to tackle him through the Passage<sup>4</sup>, whence neither were seen again.</p>
<p>The powerful urge of the Jurist-Knights to defend the lowest among us led to their tragic end when they promulgated the Zymurgy Sanctions<sup>5</sup> comdemning the Template Machines as massive human rights violations. Though many believed that the courage and resolve of the Jurist-Knights would carry the day, none predicted the invention of the Aberidus<sup>6</sup>. The weaponization of the aberidus turned the tide against the Jurist-Knights, and to this day we sing of their final and futile stand against extinction in that somber classic, "See You Space Lawyer".</p>

<h2>Magic Lever Brewery and Replete Pub</h2>
<p>The effects of the existentialist disaster, The Year of the Waiting<sup>1</sup>, have been well documented, but none are so prominent, none so wrapped in mystery, as the greatest bar to rise of the ashes of society, the <b>Magic Lever Brewery and Replete Pub</b>.  </p></div>
<p>Now, it is a well-established fact that bars were some of the few establishments to consistently thrive under the Aberidus' influence. The Magic Lever Brewery and Replete Pub was founded by Ibrahim Reed, and became stronger after the founder devoted much effort into infusing his brews with ingredients to stave off the horrifying effects of ennui. His bar was unknown until Robert Earthson met with the philosopher and inventor. After this meeting, it was revealed that he had a unique and singularly unexpected insight into the mechanics of the Aberidus, and the public flocked to his pub. </p>
<p>Earthson is associated with this bar, leading it to be a locus of myth and legend. Ibraham's middle name is Archimedes, leading to the pop legend that the pub's foundation, Archimedes' Rock<sup>2</sup>, is the actual concept noted in Tractatus Logico-Thaumaturgus<sup>3</sup>, as if the metaphor were an actual physical object. An amusing urban legend to be sure, likely stemming from the fact that the disaster was halted here.</p>

<div style="page-break-inside:avoid;">
<h2>Tractatus Logico-Thaumaturgus</h2>
<p>Walking by the execution grounds next to the Western Ducal palace, a crowd of Semi-Heretics<sup>1</sup> chanting "The Fourth Season<sup>2</sup> is at hand!" tried to push me and several others towards an eastern airlock, until, seeming to recognize me, they started to shout:  "Fido!  Fido is here!".  Ah!  The topoi we live in!  </p></div>
<p>Now that I am ensconced in a contorted looking yet cozy booth at Euclid's Folly, sipping a magnificent Stout of Unknowing: thick, dark brown head; creamy body; slightest hint of carbonation; a black void echoing with brown sugar, chocolate, raisins, coffee and hyper-berries from the Four-fold Peak,  it reminds me of the fragrant night that reigned in the Hollow Sphere, a region where the land curves up on all sides and there is no sky, but all the up-gravitating plants and trees, with all the soil clinging to them, have flown to the center forming a great island of unseen green, the Tree of Life, the Yggdrasil, a place of contemplation, reflection and meditation.  It was there that I realized my mistake.  It was there that I met my wife.</p>
<p>In some ways it is a pity that the Scholarium adopted Latin for its language.  It has given it a somewhat rigid approach to mochlomancy, epitomized by the <b>Tractatus Logico-Thaumaturgus</b> which I composed as younger, more confident man.  As Euclid's propositions formed the basis of geometry, yet are clearly insufficient for this pub, so too the Tractatus became <i>the</i> textbook for all beginning mochlomancers, yet it is not adequate for all the phenomena to be found in the <i>Realm of Deep Things</i>.  It defined all the basics: the difference between wands and levers; geo-mantic orientation; lennings<sup>3</sup>; proper etiquette and attire; dietary recommendations; enunciation and elocution; preliminary trances; woodworking skills; metal alloys; the symbolism of the smith; the uses of fire; doors and hinges; seesaws and swings, everything that seemed important at that time.</p>
<p>The older I get, the more I learn of things I do not know.  The Scholarium has spent hundreds of standard years teaching and commenting upon my book.   I am, as it were, younger than my own descendants.  How can I be sure that they are not wiser than I?</p>

<h2>Hollow Dominion</h2>
<p>The Pyroxenes rose and the land of the proud Nearside began falling away under their corrupting gaze. The effects of Ignis Ignotus grew and corrupted even the noblest of souls. The end was nigh. But there were those noble beings, those canine gods, the Doglords, who resisted. They struck a mighty blow to the Pyroxenes and halted the coming of the Replete Dominion, carving out a small circle of hope and reality in the cursed False Reality<sup>1</sup> known as the <b>Hollow Dominion</b>.</p></div>
<p>The Doglords held this line for the majority of the first and second decades. It was only when Xi Lupon<sup>2</sup> delved into works he was not qualified to handle that they began to falter. Their strength relied on their unlevered existence, and Xi mixed levered and unlevered realities, shifting the fulcrum of their existence and allowing the Pyroxenes to again press the advantage. The Doglords faded in their appearance and behavior as a result<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p>It is from this tragedy that noted metaphysicist, Dr. Fuizhen<sup>4</sup>, in his acknowledgment of the monumental mistake of Xi, solved the Key and Lock Principle and motioned to strike Xi's memory from Scholarium history. Alas, some held to the opinion that he still deserved his name, and so his legacy lives on to this day. In a drunken despair Dr. Fuizhen lamented the Doglord's sacrifice and wished that they had never descended to save those who would only glorify their betrayer<sup>5</sup>.</p>
<p>After the fall of the Hollow Dominion the False Reality grew in size and potency. It was with great reluctance that Dr. Fuizhen had to acknowledge that, with the hollowness filled and the falseness growing, it was of metaphysical definition True. His confession of this led to the marshalling of Nexus resources to combat this terror, which preserved society through the Lesser Incursion<sup>6</sup>.</p>

<h2>Omnilever</h2>
<p>The so-called <b>Omnilever</b> is the Holy Grail of mochlomancy<sup>1</sup>: a lever pivoting on a fixed point strong enough to move the heavens and the earth in accordance with mochlomantic principles. Because of the apocalyptic nature of the subject, the Nexus has banned didactic writings on the Omnilever. Therefore, the rest of this entry will be about something completely unrelated to the Omnilever.</p></div>
<p>Im<i>a</i>gine if you were kicking back and relaxing in the ol' Re<i>p</i>lete<sup>2</sup> and having y<i>o</i>urself a beer. Now, suppose <i>t</i>hat t<i>h</i>is beer was also infinitely long, rigid, and pivot<i>e</i>d on Archimedes' Rock<sup>3</sup>. Also supp<i>o</i>se that its exi<i>s</i>tence was the subject of a number of <i>i</i>nfluential paper<i>s</i> from the Lupon<sup>4</sup> archive. And, uh, suppose it was a heavy craft beer that wasn't a code for anything. With a beer like that, if you tipped the stein to your lips, you would carve a planar slice through reality itself. Because of the alcohol content, clearly, and not because of it being infinitely long and pivoted on the Rock, which it clearly isn't, because it's a beer and not the ultimate mochlomantic construction granting supreme power over the universe.</p>
<p>The taste of this beer would, of course, be divine. Unlike other beers perferred by some<sup>5</sup> that transport you to a false reality<sup>6</sup>, this beer would make everything <i>more</i> clear to you. You would be able to see pretty much anything<sup>7</sup>, I reckon. I would <b>kill</b> for a beer that good.</p>

<h2>Pyroxene Sympathizers</h2>
<p>Oh, you fools, you fools!  How long must you allow this evil in your midst?  How long, 
while you squabble for wealth and political power, while you increase your own status, 
while you let your very society crumble around you?</p></div>
<p>The hour is late, the cycle's end upon us, and you have all forgotten the horrors of the 
hell across the Passage!  Remember the Pyroxenes, those demons of metal and chitin, hunger 
and hatred!  Remember how they scythed through the wretched rabble of humanity that 
broke before them like a hammer meets glass!  Aye, bow to them, kneel to them, supplicate 
them, and all you will have achieved is a faster death!  They do not tire!  They do not 
negotiate!  They do not turn from their purpose!  For behind them is oblivion, and before 
them lies the shining light of the Nearside and the lifeblood of its peoples.  What 
creature would turn away, especially one so assured of its right to seize and slaughter?</p>
<p>Will the Semiheresy<sup>1</sup> save you?  Those craven slaves of the 
Doglords<sup>2</sup> who would rather throw their race to the demons than take 
a stand against their cruel masters?  Aye, no wonder the sympathizers have infiltrated 
their accursed ranksâ€”to the highest order, the very highest!</p>
<p>Will the Scholarium save you?  That bumbling cripple of an institution, whose 
treacherous leader<sup>3</sup> evicts his own and worships the Pyroxenes behind 
closed doors?  Whose flunkies mock the noble<sup>4</sup> and 
scorn precious lore<sup>5</sup>?  Who unleashed<sup>6</sup> our 
bitter foe in their lust for power?</p>
<p>Will the Jurist-Knights<sup>7</sup> save you?  Ah, but they have passed into myth, slain by 
the culmination<sup>8</sup> of our cruel and uncaring science!  No heroes remain in this 
twilight age.  No heroes, save only one<sup>9</sup>!</p>
<p>There are those<sup>10</sup> among the ravening hordes who were once human.  
Ignis Ignotus damned them <i>forever</i>.  Yes, <i>damnation</i>, and nothing less, is what lies 
behind the energy shields<sup>11</sup>!  Does your 
neighbor, does your friend tell you that Paradise awaits beyond?  Then strike him down, 
for he is your enemy!  For Paradise is <i>here</i>, this oasis of safety, this beacon in the 
darkness.  </p>

<h2>Zymurgy Sanctions</h2>
<p>Sitting here sipping a Semibock with Sir Calvinson owner of the Doppleheretic, "Habebo Corpus Tuum" playing in the background, it is a good time to reflect on Zymurgy and the law.  This brewery opened right before the ill-fated effort of Vidiculturists to use the Vine-Man's Convention<sup>1</sup> to outlaw all grain.  You can still see the scorch marks left by <i>Etna Fire</i> drawn from <i>Vulcan's Forge</i>.</p></div>
<p>However, the worst <b>Zymurgy sanctions</b> were instituted by the Jurist-Knights<sup>2</sup>, the masters of Nomohypnosis.  People sing of them now, and indeed, from a distance many of their feats were quite colorful, daring and useful to society.  But everything that they achieved was through the most extreme, deliberate cultivation of the <i>Archetype of the Boring</i> in the <i>Endless Library</i>.  The Template Machines were indeed a crime against Goodness, Truth and Beauty.  We owe the knights a toast and debt of song there.  Unfortunately, it is not possible to forever hold the will in the <i>Aisle of Dry Dust</i> without going mad, which is why it is so important in that kind of work to visit the springs of <i>Lesser Lethe</i>, the <i>Elysian Fields</i> or the <i>Hamlets of Demeter and Bacchus</i> unless you have someone to spot you constantly.  Even then, and the knights were careful at first, overconfidence can undermine the spotter, and both can wither away lost in the quantity of endless and irrelevant truths leading out into the void.</p>
<p>In this fatal madness, like a rabid dog that fears water, they fought against that which could have saved them:  Beer.  Fortunately or unfortunately, the Aberidus<sup>3</sup> turned on, causing the inhabitants of the Nearside to lose all interest in representative government and spirit restrictions.  The few remaining knights, seeing the tide go against them, launched into the <i>Endless Filibuster</i>.  They are still there and all attempts to rescue them and the other five MP's have failed.  The Parliament building was sealed off after the Lesser Incursion<sup>4</sup> and further rescue efforts are deemed too dangerous because of the Pyroxenes now sleeping there.  I still remember what the Year of the Waiting<sup>5</sup> looked like.  Walking toward the Nearside, the time differential made for a blur of activity which suddenly stopped.  </p>
<p>Now that we have survived thus far, it is our sacred duty as Zymurgists to bring peace and unity to a troubled Nearside, to heal those broken by ennui, to give rest to minds shattered by arcane depths, to bring inspiration to our best minds, to transcend logic and individuality, to save not the human race but the human soul!</p>

<h2>Calathas the Unholy</h2>
<p>For anyone who has ever bothered to study the society of late old earth, it is obvious that Calathas the Unholy is a very common literary trope of the kind inspired by H. P. Lovecraft, the founder of the eponymous Free Love movement.  The only positive evidence for its existence is to be found in wads of dog-bedding quoted by Scholastics with a vested interest in producing paperwork; Duke Strato's proclamations with their constant need to create enemies without and heroes within to deflect attention from numerous scandals, incompetencies and executions; references from dog-worshippers who lack the mental coherence to be full heretics; and the beer induced ravings of that drunken sot and dabbler in the Kupakamasutra Robert Earthson.  Latin rhythms about court room super men are too ridiculous for further mention.</p></div>
<p>Many people find Calathas a convenient <i>Diabolus ex machina</i> to explain the demise of the Doglords<sup>1</sup>, the reduction of the human population by 99.73%, the prevalence of necromantic cults, the existence of hordes of ravenous chitin and metal monstrosities, long lines for New You(TM) Aberidus<sup>2</sup> Templates, Shahan Fuizhen's<sup>3</sup> bad hair, and unpredictably long IIPA hangovers.  It is ridiculous! It is laziness!  If you don't understand something, go to Vulcan's Forge yourself and move the Cyclopean levers, don't invent ghosts and hobgoblins like our benighted ancestors (Earthson included)!  </p>

<h2>Moment of Pardon</h2>
<p>The <b>Moment of Pardon</b> is a once-per-cycle event, observed in memory of the end of the 
first cycle, when the Semiheresy<sup>1</sup> used brutal and excessive 
force to evict humanity from the Nearside, leading the deaths of 7,500 innocents.  The 
tragedy caused much turmoil for the next hundred years, and many feared that the end of 
the second cycle would be far more disastrous.  But clearer heads, miraculously, prevailed, 
and the Truth and Reconciliation Conference on Semiheresy was instituted to assist 
humanity in coming to terms with the necessity of facing the Pyroxene horrors at the end 
of every cycle.  </p></div>
<p>The outcomes of that conference are too numerous to list here, but the 
important one for our purposes was the Moment of Pardon.  Held at midnight 7,500 days 
before E-Dayâ€”in honor of the 7,500 victims of the first cycleâ€”the Moment of Pardon is a 
time for all of us to acknowledge our strife and forgive our enemies, that we might stand 
as one on the literally unearthly battlefields of the False Reality.</p>
<p>As it is the function of the nobility to set a noble example for the common man, on this 
Moment of Pardon, I shall honor the custom publicly.  Of late, my foremost enemy has been 
one Dr. Edgar Ronson, a man with whom I have had no small number of academic debates, but 
more importantly was the man whose resource allocation decisions led to the end of my 
career in the Scholarium.</p>
<p>But I must admit that Dr. Ronson is a great man.  During the Lesser Incursion<sup>2</sup>, he 
developed vital upgrades for the GCVS systems<sup>3</sup>
by an ingenius application of the Key and Lock Principle<sup>4</sup>, even when doing so required 
making the controversial decision to seal off Parliament and the last remnant of the 
Jurist-Knights<sup>5</sup> and their Semiheretic auxiliary forces.  There are those who questioned 
his decision, but not I, for we both understand that we can hold nothing back against the 
odious Pyroxenes.</p>
<p>Dr. Ronson's character also shines through in his support of Robert Earthson, the hero of 
our age<sup>6</sup>, and the necessity of constructing the Omnilever<sup>7</sup> so that 
we may defeat our foes once and for all.  "[The Scholarium] stands with Earthson," he once 
told me in private communication.  And so I speak the words instituted by tradition: "Here 
is a man who I will gladly fight beside."</p>

<h2>Shahan Fuizhen</h2>
<p><i>The following were excerpted from a Semiheresy internal memo leaked by an anonymous source.</i></p></div>
<p>[...] resolved with the utmost haste. Though his powerful contacts in the upper echelons of the Scholarium allow him to maintain a behind-the-scenes position of <i>de facto</i> control, in his unnatural and abhorrent old age he has grown too paranoid. The threads of loyalty he holds so tightly are fraying. I suppose lackeys are only willing to cover up so many Pyroxene ritual murders before they start to rethink their devotions. I even heard from a demipriest that some now suspect he's been dead for decades and mock his extant body as "Shahang"<sup>1</sup>, a wretched, soulless husk "hanging on" in a diabolical mockery of life. (Ah, for the idyllic disputes of academia!) Speaking of [...]</p>
<p>[...] remains a potent foe to our hegemony in the Nearside. He has, in anticipation of the upcoming fourth season<sup>2</sup>, pushed for it to be made an open research topic. You and I both know that the Semiheresy cannot allow [REDACTED] to be enunciated by Scholarium personnel. If only he were willing to have his tongue cut out like Dr. Lupon<sup>3</sup>, but the fool insists on keeping his most dangerous weapon. And the eagerness with which he moved to strike Lupon from Scholarium history? He strikes me as someone with a lot to hide.</p>
<p>In truth, Osmodius, I see no hypothesis so compelling as that Dr. Fuizhen either was from the beginning, or became after researching too far into depths best left unplumbed, an agent for the Pyroxenes in human skin. No son of the Nearside would have thought to call that nightmare realm "True Reality", even resignedly. His <i>Atlas Arcanum</i> contains too many errors and "inspired" leaps for how accurate his conclusions have been. I cannot shake the fear that through him the Pyroxenes have been perusing the depths of Nexus archives since the last cycle. It is too much of a coincidence that we had kept the Pyroxenes at bay for cycles, yet as soon as he discovered the principle of bypassing the defenses<sup>4</sup> on the Passage, the Pyroxenes immediately broke through them. In fact, I just submitted my latest report on that damnable incident, which [...]</p>
<p>[...] and as for Dr. Fuizhen, our patience has borne the expected fruit. It will not be difficult to move on him. We only await the approval of the warrants.</p>

<h2>They Who Watch Unblinking</h2>
<p>The principle of mochlomancy<sup>1</sup> is quite simple. Energy is redirected by applying said energy against a lever positioned on a fulcrum. Yanner's Inversion<sup>2</sup> is the most famous example of this, producing not only a new topology of earth, but breaking the topology of spacetime itself. Thus the Doglords<sup>3</sup> came to be known. Their eternal gaze has only been shared by a few, the most worthy of humans, the elite of the members of the Nearside. Robert Earthson was the first to venture to this strange new population and bring back the tidings of the lords. It is well known of their great stand against False Reality<sup>4</sup>, and of their tragic fall. But what Earthson uncovered trivializes even those actions. </p></div>
<p>The gaze of the Doglords is fixed in space, but not in time. Gazing towards the center of the torus, they see all time, and therefore, paradoxically, all things, for time was distorted as space was. They knew the rise of the Pyroxenes would come, they knew the Hollow Dominion would fail, and they chose their actions accordingly. What did they see in the future that gave them this confidence? Did they see hope, or despair? The sureness of victory leading to their sacrifice, or the inevitability of defeat giving way to despair? What motivated their actions? Did they see the omnilever<sup>5</sup>? Or did they see Calathas<sup>6</sup>?</p>
<p>Some suggest, and I am inclined to agree, though I tremble at the implication, that time has taken the exact curvature of space. Proof is impossible, and Yanner's exact spell is still somewhat a mystery. If this is true, then not even the Doglords would see this. Their defeat would be eternally repeated, their victory would be release. The Doglords, the starers into eternity, have risked all. </p>
<p>Only time will tell. And we have little left.</p>

<h2>Fourth Season</h2>
<p>The Fourth Season is illegal.  Therefore most people believe that it exists since why legislate against something that isn't there?  Of course that argument would never have stopped the filibustering Latin-tongued bores<sup>1</sup>.</p></div>
<p>It is an artifact, a false prediction of the obsessive binary division<sup>2</sup> of reality put forward by the half-brained semi-heretics<sup>3</sup>.     Why is it that the half-hearted enforcers want to push humanity into the chitinous horrors of H. G. Orwell's worst nightmares?  The answer lies in their very half-heartedness!  True full-blooded heretics, who have truly embraced the ideal of heresy for its own sake, would never stoop to such trite apocalyptic orthodoxy!  They would reject them <i>de priore</i> as beneath their dignity! </p>
<p>Ancient Egypt had three seasons:  Planting, Flood and Harvest.  Even if you insist on nostalgic archaeogaiism, there is no need for powers of two.  Does Robert Earthson<sup>4</sup> ever lend support to the notion of a Fourth Season?  It is merely a passing fad!</p>
<p>Scintillate, Jazzy and Negative are the only real seasons on the Nearside.  Let me explain them since, apparently it isn't clear to you yet: Scintillate when the magnetic fields of the two disks of the donut moon visible from here cause all long haired dogs (and cats) too give off dangerous static charges and women look rather pretty;  Jazzy, when all the tides are pulled out of the harbors giving a spectacular natural amphitheatre for jazz concerts in the temperate zones; Negative, very dangerous for people with up-gravitational orientation which becomes much stronger at this time (they also tend to get rather irritable and negative.)</p>
<p>Those killjoys!  The end of negative and beginning of scintillate is the best time of cycle for the heroic sport of moon jumping<sup>5</sup> for those of us who can (and have you ever heard of a semi-heretic with up-gravitation?)  No they will kill for beer<sup>6</sup> and even then, it is only cold-bloodedly for power, like dead dogs.</p>

<h2>Lennings</h2>
<p>Though I look upon the Tractatus Logico-Thaumaturgus<sup>1</sup> with skepticism, here is where I must concede that it serves its reader well. <b>Lennings</b> are a fundamental practice of Mochlomancy<sup>2</sup>, a fulcrum to the magical lever. The more lennings employed, the more stable the spell. However, to employ a lenning requires costly power, and so one sacrifices power for stability, hence the neverending search for Archimedes' Rock<sup>3</sup>, the final lenning, which would allow a mochlomantic spell to have perfect stability with no tax on the power. This problem has vexed researchers for years, and more recently has come to the forefront of the inversion<sup>4</sup> phenomenon. Robert Earthson has been working on his omnilever<sup>5</sup> for quite some time, but even this fantastical invention, would not be able to function without stability, and to create lennings powerful enough to stabilize such a device would drain all power from the system. But with a device that provides its own stability would dodge such a difficulty. Scholarium metaphysicists, including myself, have postulated that if such a device were to exist, it is conceivable that we could reverse the damned effects Yanner wrought decades ago.</p></div>
<p>The search continues, and it is my professional opinion that it is a fable, a myth. But it is a hope, and in these final hours I must confess before all, that it is a hope I myself indulge in.</p>

<h2>The Year of the Waiting</h2>
<p>As I escape from the dungeons of the Semiheresy with my rescuer, the incomparable Robert 
Earthson, and former and present colleague Dr. Ronson, I find myself reflecting on ancient 
puzzles.</p></div>
<p>I ask myself, what is the worth of a man?  Surely not an unfamiliar question to those of 
us who survived the <b>Year of the Waiting</b>, watching as the Template Machines of the 
Aberidus<sup>1</sup> produced endless copies of ourselvesâ€”our selvesâ€”but stronger, smarter, <i>better</i>, 
even as the semiheresy<sup>2</sup> assured us they were leverless, 
demonstrably without souls.  Who among us could fail to fall into listlessness, seeing our 
dearest dreams and wishes fulfilled by the gods we might have been?  What is it about our 
leveredness that binds us to this fractured and absurd world?  And who could blame us for 
waiting for some hero to appear and hand us an answer?</p>
<p>I asked myself because I first asked myself, why are there five bivalence genera<sup>3</sup>?  
The <i>Tractatus</i><sup>4</sup> predicts an even number, reasoning from 
the Principle of Balance.  But, noticing my confusion, Earthson told me that there has always 
been a sixth: <i>mochlontic bivalence</i>, the phenomenon of leveredness or unleveredness.  
And his answer suddenly made a great deal clear to me, for I was asking these questions as 
Dr. Ronson and I perused the confidential files Earthson casually stole on our way out of 
the Partial Vatican.  According to him, it was why he allowed himself to be arrested in 
the first place.</p>
<p>And so now I ask myself, how did the Pyroxenes effect the Replete Dominion in the face of 
Nexus efforts?</p>
<p>For the Pyroxenes and the Doglords Imperious<sup>5</sup> were both of unleveredness, and left alone 
should have struggled fruitlessly for eternity.  But our levered existence tipped the balanceâ€”
and should have ended the struggle in the Doglords' favor, but in truth the opposite occurred.  
How?</p>
<p>The answer, as these documents reveal, is none other than the Semiheresy itself.  Their 
agents sabotaged the work of long-dead researchers to result in the creation of Ignis Ignotus<sup>6</sup>,
that which saps the leveredness from the world.  With the Doglords dead, they mean to assume 
full control of humanity.  What is the worth of humanity?  There is a weight to our existence, 
a weight born of struggle and striving, of the pursuit of value, that Pyroxene agents nearly 
succeeded in extinguishing with the Year of the Waiting.  Why?  Why is our existence significant?</p>
<p>And then I understand, at last I understand, why the Semiheresy has banned research on the 
Omnilever<sup>7</sup>: there is no Omnilever.</p>
<p><i>We</i> are the Omnilever.</p>
<p>The three of us have gone into hiding, but the day is coming when we will return.  Hear 
these words and remember: the cycle's end approaches, and this time <i>we will win.</i></p>
