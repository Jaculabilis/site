<p><i>You are the survivors of the Happenstancening, trying to piece together how it was that the Seven Strictures failed the Central Order.</i></p>

<h1>The King's Altitude</h1>
<p>When the Order of St. Aquila of the Pen, to which I belong, was first founded in the 12th century, it was charged with "promoting the sober study of edifying texts". However, due to a translation error and the undue zeal of its founding abbess, St. Annihilatrix the Vindictive, the Aquilines instead embarked on a ruthless campaign of imposed asceticism. With their <a href="The_Bear_Inquisition.html">well-known martial prowess</a>, they conquered several city-states and forced those under their thrall to forgo the pleasures of fine foods, drink, and sex, in favor of studying ancient manuscripts. Unfortunately, a surprising number of the texts that populated their library were highly erotic in nature, ranging from evocative mystical treatises to simple conjugal manuals. The result was an excessive amount of, shall we way, "practical application" going in in the Order's scriptoria.</p>
<p>This came to an end with the ascension of St. Annihilatrix's successor, Bl. Purgess the One-Eyed. Bl. Purgess made a few attempts at stopping the goings-on, then gave up and commissioned the <i>Hasta Regis Altissima</i>, the Highest Lance of the King. The <i>Altissima</i> was equipped with aetheric technology that would not be discovered until the late 13th century, including a Dediscombobulator that allowed it to seek out and destroy hanky-panky from a safe altitude of ten thousand meters. This had two major effects: first, the destruction of most of the scriptoria where the goings-on were going on; and second, a rapid increase in technological advancement motivated by the need to stop Bl. Purgess from driving the human race to extinction.</p>
<p>The Aquiline menace was halted when the Improvised Order finally launched <a href="Ontological_Abstractions_and_How_to_Beat_Them_to_Death.html" class="phantom">the combat philosopher Regina Knorff</a> high enough to reach the <i>Altissima</i>, who then used <a href="The_Binding_Stricture.html" class="phantom">the Binding Stricture</a> to defeat Bl. Purgess and take control of the Order. Under the rule of Abbess Regina, the Order of St. Aquila returned to the one remaining scriptorium to begin the task of restoring the texts damaged by Bl. Purgess' policies and turned the <i>Altissima</i> over to royal control. On the order of the Crown Prince, Edgar Summers, it was rechristened <b>The King's Altitude</b> and became th winter home of the royal family and the base of operations of <a href="The_Ministry_of_Not_Screwing_Things_Up.html">the Ministry of Not Screwing Things Up</a>. There must have been some of Bl. Purgess' spirit bound to it, though, because it descended slowly over the next few decades, eventually wiping out several mountain villages.</p>
