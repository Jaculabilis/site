<p><i>You are the survivors of the Happenstancening, trying to piece together how it was that the Seven Strictures failed the Central Order.</i></p>

<h1>Affirmator</h1>
<p>When I came to, the nun from earlier and a wizened librarian were pouring over <i>The Laws of the Strictures, Volume 22</i>.  A woman in a Strictures United uniform wearing a name tag that said "Susanna Summers" was looking through the bar's food supplies.  Q was repairing the tinfoil covering as gunfire sounded outside.  Sounded like SU wasn't happy with our little resistance party.  Weren't there angry bears for them to shoot instead?</p>
<p>With a groan, I pulled myself off the floor.</p>
<p>"Ah!  The eye that keeps to himself!" said the librarian happily.  "We were just fondling your answer."</p>
<p>Sister Avacillata looked pained at that phrase but didn't say anything.</p>
<p>"Towards the end," I said, rubbing the new bump on my head.  "There was something about redefining <a href="Existence.html">existence</a> using a power ever greater than the Strictures.  I didn't have time to read it, but maybe—"</p>
<p>"Of course!  Yes, yes, of course, this is a <a href="Happe.html">Happe</a> circumstance," the librarian said, having already found the page in question.  "All we need is an <b>Affirmator</b>."</p>
<p>"There hasn't been an Affirmator for hundreds of years," said Sister Avacillata.  "Do you just expect one to stroll into the bar because it's convenient?  While we're under fire from our own damn military?"</p>
<p>"They're not our military!" shouted Q, scrambling over to the table.  "They're all imposters, figments of our imagination!  As soon as any of us realize it, they'll go away!"</p>
<p>"That's ridiculous," said Sister Avacillata, but whatever she said next, I didn't hear because Q was talking over her.</p>
<p>"Ooh, my favorite!  Almonds!" said Summers.</p>
<p>Immediately, the gunfire ceased.  All of us looked at her simultaneously.</p>
<p>"What?" she said.</p>
<p>"We... really like almonds," I said slowly.  Making eye contact with the others, I pointed significantly at a particular point on the page.  I continued significantly, "in fact, it really raises our morale when you mention it."</p>
<p>At that moment, another figure crashed through the tinfoil.  He absentmindedly blocked Q's reflexive hammer blow and surveyed us.  Summers screamed.</p>
<p>"Bear!" yelled Sister Avacillata, charging him.</p>
<p>"Wait, friends!" said the bear.  "I mean you no harm.  I come bearing a dire warning.  The <a href="Wise_Bob2C_the_Sequitor_who_Exploded_Most_Direly.html">Great Weapon</a> has been loosed!  It will consume all but the <a href="Unnamed_City.html">Unnamed City</a>, unless—"</p>
<p>Thinking quickly, I interrupted him, saying, "That's just what SU <i>wants</i> you to think!  It's actually completely harmless!"  I nudged Q with my elbow and he began to talk over the bear.</p>
<p>"They call it the Great Weapon to addle your sheeplike mind, but actually—"</p>
<p>"Listen!" the bear shouted back. "You can hear its rumble even now as it comes to—"</p>
<p>"Nothing's actually happening—"</p>
<p>I waved at Summers and said, "Hey!  We need some morale over here!"</p>
<p>"Almonds!" she said cheerfully.</p>
<p>The rumbling, which had been building in the background, stopped.  Silence fell on all of us, and then we cheered.  Summers, pleased at the effect she was having on us, joined in the cheer.</p>
<p>"Q!" I said.  "I heard there wasn't even an invasion going on right now!"</p>
<p>"I knew it!" he said.  "It's all a plot to—"</p>
<p>The librarian jumped in.  "What a happenstance!  So many have waited for this moment, but—"</p>
<p>"Almonds!" said Summers again, and we all cheered again.</p>
<p>We saved the world that night.  And the rest—at least, until Summers learns the word "Zemben"—is history.</p>
