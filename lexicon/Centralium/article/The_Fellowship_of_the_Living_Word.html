<p><i>You are the survivors of the Happenstancening, trying to piece together how it was that the Seven Strictures failed the Central Order.</i></p>

<div class="content">
<h1>The Fellowship of the Living Word</h1>
<p>War... war never changes.  </p>
<p>Until the part where you break out some KICKASS POWER ARMOR and go a RAMPAGING THROUGH THE STREETS of <a href="Grampul_Subsection_3.html">WHERE THE FUCK EVER</a>!  </p>
<p>BOOYAH! </p>
<p>With a couple exceptions they don't let you out of the Fellowship until you've achieved <a href="The_King27s_Altitude.html">rulership</a>, so the last couple hundred of us are Lucin's World natives ever since that transporter accident with Original Eurythian and Von Doomsday.  That <i>apparently</i> means that when one of us merges with the Archives in the Scriptorium and the other consumes half a million orphans it tends to <i>do</i> things to you.  Like unnatural speed and this weird hunger for people's gall bladders.  For me it's the gall bladder, I know Eddie here prefers liver.  </p>
<p>Anyway as a devout Noted Scholar (third class, rank upsilon) it's my job to kick some <a href="The_Bear_Inquisition.html">bear asses</a> and chew orphan-soul gum. And the entire world has nearly run out of orphans (well, until recently that is).  </p>
<p>This would be a bit more of a shitshow but for two major reasons (other than the whole 'powered by forsaken children' thing of course).  </p>
<p>1. Bruh, we've been <a href="D.E.A.T.H.S.T.A.R..html">embedded in Strictures United</a> since the <a href="Unnamed_City.html">abject failure</a> that was the 3rd Crusade.  </p>
<p>2. I kind of forgot what 2. was gonna be because like, the Leeching Stricture just kicked in and </p>
<p>3. o yea we stole Stricture based <a href="Logomancy.html" class="phantom">logomancy</a> from SU, which would USUALLY drive you totally nutso to use the way we been using but like, when your psychic register links right to a sapient library it can kinda offload the madness into random gibberish and offshunted energies that cause <a href="Grand_Executor_Jargan.html">spontaneous surprise parties</a>.  Mostly.  </p>
<p>4. Of course since the most SURPRISING party is one in which your gall bladder is suddenly and generously donated to a kind, scholarly Noted Scholar over here, </p>
<p>6. goddamn I'm hungry.</p>
<p>5. and you are full of blood and meat and electricity and fats, fatty acids, amniotic fluids and chyme and synovia and dreams and hopes and rage and lymph </p>
<p>8. stuff and fill and glut and swallow chew consume drink leech slurp gulp swallow</p>
<p>9. rip n tear rip n tear RIP AND TEAR RIP AND TEAR RIP AND TEAR</p>
<p>9. YOU ARE A BEAR THAT MEANS YOU HAVE HUGE GUTS</p>
<p>9. RIP AND TEAR YOUR GUTS</p>
<p>Sorry.  That probably wasn't very scholarly.  Thought it certainly was uh, surprising.  bears dont go down easy i tell u that.  For some reason the Happe go down even harder.  Should look into recruiting them or sommat.  </p>
<p>Fuck this place is going down the tubes.  The Ascended is moving off, so we beat a retreat - LET the bears have the Central Order.  What's left here anyway?  </p>
<p>We've got an even juicier target all swollen with blood and sebum and cerebral-spinal fluid.  Left alone by the Order ever since the Unwritten Stricture rendered it <a href="Unnamed_City.html">unnameable</a>.  </p>
<p>It sure was nice of SU to <a href="Seirapolis.html">relocate all our deep-cover embedded agents to Bear Central</a>.  The Scriptorium thinks that <a href="Unnamed_City.html">there's something big and juicy inside</a>.  Something that maybe the Ascended can eat.  Maybe.  </p>
<p>But best of all, it boasts the largest orphanage of ANYWHERE.  </p>
