<p><i>You are the survivors of the Happenstancening, trying to piece together how it was that the Seven Strictures failed the Central Order.</i></p>

<h1>White Lab Coats</h1>
<p>They say that in some parts of the Antipode Order, the sidewalks get hot enough to fry an egg on.  Brings a new meaning to "sunny side up."  Waste of an egg, if you ask me, but no one ever asks me.  </p>
<p>People also say that you can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs.  As I walked through the gloomy drizzle, I caught a glimpse of the broken sphere that used to be the <a href="Seirapolis.html">Seirapolis</a>.  One hell of a broken egg, that one.  They hadn't finished rebuilding the destruction from when the Strictures ran loose after the <a href="Vin2C_Vice_President_Carnold.html">energy reactors went down</a>.  I shuddered to think what kind of omelet was getting cooked up from that.</p>
<p>Lighting a cigarette, I decided to check up on a contact of mine who might know more about what SU was planning.  He was a bit of a reticent fellow, refusing to go by anything other than "Q".  From what I knew of the man(?), it probably wasn't even his real initial. But he was an absolute tech whiz, and if anyone had deeper access to SU's systems, it'd be him.</p>
<p>The apartment complex was dilapidated and full of unsavory characters.  I guess I look like a bit of an unsavory character myself, because none of them gave me any trouble beyond intimidating glares. I found my way to a darkened hallway.  The tripwires didn't pose much of a problem, unless you count the one that set my trenchcoat on fire.</p>
<p>With a light knock on his door, I flung myself backward so the flamethrower behind the door wouldn't flash-broil me.</p>
<p>"Who are you?  How did you find this location?" snapped a distorted voice through a speaker.</p>
<p>"It's Murph, and you gave me directions last time you had an anonymous tip that couldn't be spoken over the phone."  Ten bucks said this wasn't his real location, either, but if I brought that up he might activate the proximity mines.</p>
<p>"Hah!  They've got all of the phones, I tell you!  Might as well mail them a transcript of your day!" </p>
<p>"I'm wondering what else they've got," I said.  "Can you tell me anything about Carnelian's plans for Central?"</p>
<p>"It's all about the <a href="An_Apology_-_from_Strictures_United.html">Thirteenth</a>, I tell you," said the voice.  "<i>All</i> of Carnelian's memos <i>sum to a multiple of thirteen if you convert them to binary and add the ones together</i>!"</p>
<p>"Do you know what they're going to use the Thirteenth for?"</p>
<p>"Nothing yet.  They've got to bring it to life first," said the voice.  "I've hacked the security cameras in their <a href="Logomancy.html">logomantic</a> research wing.  Do you know what I <a href="Zetta_Computing.html">saw</a>?"</p>
<p>"Not a clue."</p>
<p>"Perfect.  Stay the hell out of my head."  The voice paused for a moment, then continued.  "Anyways, Mr. Reynolds, I saw <i>white lab coats</i>."</p>
<p>I whistled.  You only see white lab coats on people who have gone off the deep end — for example, I had no doubt my friend Q here was wearing one.  That meant Strictures United had to be employing actual mad scientists.  Mighty suspicious for an organization dedicated to preventing that.</p>
<p>"The implications are obvious," the voice continued.</p>
<p>"Of course," I lied.  "Well, I'm off to investigate some mad logomancers.  You know where to find me."</p>
<p>"Goodbye.  Mind the privacy hammer on your way out."</p>
<p>"What privacy—"</p>
