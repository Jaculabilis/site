<h1>Cathyr Van Sacrilege</h1>
<p><b>Cathyr Van Sacrilege</b> looms as one of the most enigmatic figures of ancient, near-ancient, and nearly-recent history. It may well be said of her that she is the answer to the questionâ€”<i>Who?</i> </p>
<p>Born to John and Jane of the ill-destinied Doe family at some point in the early near-ancient, Polly Anne Anne Doe decided at a remarkably young age that she would avoid at all costs the common family fate of mysterious deaths and occasional posthumous renamings. If existent records of her are indeed true, she had hardly begun to speak when she began to defy death.</p>
<p>According to some variants of some legends, <b>Cathyr Van Sacrilege</b>, then still Polly Anne Anne Doe, first encountered the thought of the idea of the possibility of -stancening while still a toddler. Most records have, however, been destroyed amid the hullabalooic destruction surrounding the <a href="The_King27s_Altitude.html"><i>Altissima</i></a>. Perhaps most significant of the records destroyed was an account by <b>Cathyr Van Sacrilege</b> herself of the time she tricked <a href="Satan.html">"the devil hisself"</a> into selling her the secret of immortality in exchange for his own virginity. Much embarrassed by the whole affair, the devil spent the following years writing mythical erotica, some of which was the very reason for the reforms of the Order that led to <a href="The_King27s_Altitude.html">the destruction of the records</a></p>
<p>From the devile, <b>Cathyr Van Sacrilege</b> learned immortality and it was from <a href="Larry27s_Conquest.html">Larry</a> that she learned the secrets of the virtual. It was through the double play of these that <a href="The_Unwritten_Stricture.html">her sapience became unbounded</a>. Unbounded as it was, she was able to evade <a href="The_Binding_Stricture.html">The Binding Stricture</a> with a sort of <a href="The_Kappanstancing.html">imaginary realism</a>. It may well have been that it was this evasion itself which allowed her to set the Stricture of the the Happenstancening in motion, or rather, to <a href="The_Kappanstancing.html">"set it up"</a>, in such a way that it, not her, appeared guilty. Needless to say, it does seem that at least some see her as the primeval culprit of it all. <i>Who?</i> indeed. And how has not a single soul spoken out about the vehicular similarity between <b>Cathyr Van Sacrilege</b> and Vin <i>Jeep</i> Carnold? Lastly, does she get off <a href="The_Order_which_is_Definitely_Not_Central.html">torturing the devil</a>? This may be terribly important.</p>
