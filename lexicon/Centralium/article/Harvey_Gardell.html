<h1>Harvey Gardell</h1>
<p><i>Wow! What a totally crazy opportunity! Like, if I had more experience in this field I would totally apply! Mr. Harvey Gardell is such an inspirtion, he alone created at least 5 Strictures! I've even gotten to meet one before, <a href="The_Latitant_Macrophobic_Limaciform_Stricture.html">the Great LaMaLi</a>, he always looks so lonely.</i> </p>
<p><i>Anyways, my coworker, Ryan Radford, he once got to like, see a real <a href="Flamenco_Dance-Off.html" class="phantom">flamenco challenge</a>!!! The "once seventh" Stricture was challenged by the "now seventh" Stricture, and like, when he fell, it was such a totally crazy collapse! After 37 hours of pure flamenco dancing, that was it! </i></p>

<p><b>To: </b><i>General Staff, Front Desk, Susanna Summers</i></p>
<p><b>From: </b><i>Strictures United</i></p>
<p><b>CC: </b><i>Executive Branch</i></p>
<p><b>Date: </b><i>August 13th, 3014</i></p>
<p><b>Subject: </b><i>New Position Available</i></p>
<p>Attention Staff,</p>
<p>As we all know, our very own Harvey Gardell, is reaching an age due for retirement. Next January, Mr. Gardell, will be approaching his 75th birthday. </p>
<p>Starting now, we will be accepting applications for an assistant to Mr. Gardell to study under, learn from him, and eventually take hold of his current position as Stricture Developer.</p>
<p>Position Details:</p>
<p><b>Stricture Developer</b></p>
<p>The successful candidate will be responsible for creating, evaluating and manipulating designs to meet the needs of our Strictures. We focus on energy-efficient designs, as we know each Stricture is both written law and an embodied life-form that can be challenged to a <a href="Flamenco_Dance-Off.html" class="phantom">flamenco dance-off</a>, so they need to be well designed in order to dance well and protect the standing of those laws. If a Stricture you develop fails to a superior dancer, the stricture is no longer upheld law, and you will be subject to capital punishment. Additionally, the ideal candidate should be open to contributing designs to our online repository of back up blueprints. Such contributions earn commissions in addition to the candidate’s base salary. If you are looking for an exciting opportunity to join the executive branch of <a href="Strictures_United.html">Strictures United</a>, we’re interested in meeting with you.</p>
