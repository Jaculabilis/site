<h1>Wise Bob, the Sequitor who Exploded Most Direly</h1>
<p>Communique 63:// #subsector 5, High Office Chamberlain</p>
<p>AethID 06660-09:/ CalypsoNet</p>
<p>"When the heretic assails without fear, when corruption coils around all, when madness and chaos abound, seek then your consolation in blood. Offer no longer salvation to the undeserving, but drown them with damnation." Last proclamation of Brother Albright the Sanguine Rage, Chief Warbear of the 4th Great  Crusade, moments before the massacre of the 5 Cities and the Red Tide.</p>
<p>From: Ursinquisitor Thelemas Tier</p>
<p>Greetings Blessed Chamberlain of All Fury,</p>
<p>The great work has been accomplished.</p>
<p>All has been prepared and events have been set in motion which now cannot be undone. The Great Weapon has been loosed.</p>
<p>As you know, the curiously named "Wise Bob" was a figure of no little repute in the annals and traditions of the Sequitor people. Though we have had few dealings with them across the years, some of their lore has indeed passed into the memory of the Ursinquisitous. Although his name appears to me as something of a misappellation-- given that he appears to have died from <a href="Typhus_Stormbreaker.html">self-inflicted wounds</a> incurred from interaction with the Great Weapon--perhaps it is the lesson learned vicariously by his actions that is the source of the so-called wisdom.</p>
<p>Likewise, we know the Sequitors learned from this wisdom and hid the Great Weapon deep underground, safe from the touch of fire that would awaken it. Surprisingly, with perhaps a primitive instinct and awareness, they dug leagues of tunnels that follow the precise course of the <a href="Great_Bear27s_Veins.html">Great Bear's Veins</a>, with the Great Weapon stockpiled at the tunnels' ends, located deep within the hearts of the various Orders. </p>
<p>Our Crusade, on account of dire need, has prepared these stockpiles, and sent the <a href="Seirapolis.html">refugees from the Central Order</a> on "meditative pilgrimages" to the stockpiles. They are there repeating their "wellness mantra" constantly, in shifts. </p>
<p>When the Great Weapon is awoken, the constant recitation of the Piercing Stricture will open the aether, channeling a torrent of Fire and Void into the heart of every Order, and thus cleansing them in a great conflagration which will then collapse into Nothingness, obliterating all trace of the Orders as well as the infected refugees from the Central Order.</p>
<p><a href="Wrathrunes.html">Wrathrunes</a> have been placed in the prescribed sigils around the Unnamed City to protect it from any residual Void or damage and cutting it off from the aether. </p>
<p>By the time this message reaches you, the Great Weapon will have been unleashed, and corruption will have been thus purged from the Orders. 
I may not be able to communicate for some time as the aether will be blocked with the final Wrathrune as soon as this message is transmitted.</p>
<p>All is now in the claws of the Great Bear.</p>
<p>I remain humble in your service, and with great wrath to all corruption,</p>
<hr><span class="signature"><p>Brother Thelemas Tier, Ursinquisitor, 3rd Order of the Blooded Claw and Penitent of All Mysteries, Boneroarer of the 5th Great Crusade.</p></span>
