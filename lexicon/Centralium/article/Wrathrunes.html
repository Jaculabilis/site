<p><i>You are the survivors of the Happenstancening, trying to piece together how it was that the Seven Strictures failed the Central Order.</i></p>

<h1>Wrathrunes</h1>
<p>Originating with the <i>Romani</i> of Old-Near-Ancient Europa, <b>Wrathrunes</b> are a magic ward against snakes, serpents, basilisks, mothers-in-law, and, in a most general way, things that <i>coil and loose</i>. Part of the ward had from its earliest inception, of course, a particularly nomadic focus on loosing. The magic was thoroughly effective, particularly against distant cousins named Danior, Django, Maloney, Kennick, and Jim-bo.</p>
<p>While the materials used for <b>Wrathrunes</b> have varied over the years, their shape has remained remarkably unchanged, appearing always like a doily. </p>
<p>Before the destruction of <a href="Larry27s_Conquest.html">The Last Virtual Stone</a> the doilies of the <b>Wrathrune</b> were made often of the agate. The agate had largely removed itself to the virtual by then, for understandable reasons, and it has since been virtually mined to near-extinction. It was indeed a most magnificent destruction (and possibly extinction)—perhaps The Very Best.</p>
<p>Prior to and since the aforementioned probable extinction of the agate, <b>Wrathrunes</b> have been primarily composed of juniper, twigs of Elder, root of raspberry, or shark teeth soaked in wine. Contraveneno was used up until the rise of <a href="Science-Related_Memetic_Disorder.html">SRMD</a>, as the rise of Science (and all things “science”) tend to bring with them “rigorous” “studies” of things fixated on the material. Toxicity rose as SRMD increased and soon enough California was aware that it caused cancer. </p>
<p>Since the Happenstancening, <b>Wrathrunes</b> have migrated. No longer are they the conjuring/creation/delicate-lacy-work of humans only. Once upon a time (we are told, all of us, each one, as though uncannily, as though as waketime stories) the words of <a href="The_Happenstancening.html">Cathyr Van Sacrilege</a>: “the hubris of humanity thinking we could bind the Strictures was not in thinking our technology would hold but rather our fickle and corrupt nature” — and this, on repeat, for hours. (It was the sound—nay, the heartbeat—of our nights, all of us, each one.) They fly north for the summer, <b>Wrathrunes</b> do, since then, and their flight is terrible. The only ones to remain are the ashen ones, the juniper ones, usually. It was, needless to say, the very corruption of human nature which caused the Strictures to fail. There was no other reason. None. Zippo. There could be no other. How else was it that agate went near-extinct? </p>

<p>Lo! I must tell you this, not as a scholar or a sub-sub-librarian, nor even as a repentant sub-ambibeliever, but as Carver Goodmann himself: the <b>Wrathrunes</b> must be permitted to migrate. The world—the Orders, all that is, the Strictures, everything, 42—are in a time of great…stress. We must permit the <b>Wrathrunes</b> to migrate. We must. Now is no longer the age of the hubris of humanity. Stuff it all for a lack. It is the age of the Hubris of the Happe and the Sequitor. Perhaps an <a href="Affirmator.html" class="phantom">Affirmator</a> may arrive, and soon, and our technology can be wholly poo-pooed and we can say again, as we once did: þæt wæs god cyning.
Goodnight, America.</p>
