<p><i>You are the survivors of the Happenstancening, trying to piece together how it was that the Seven Strictures failed the Central Order.</i></p>

<div class="content">
<h1>The Breaching Stricture</h1>
<p>Notice, notice, notice here my poor petty pretties that the Strictures have order; therefore they uphold the Order.  Order of what description?  It doesn't matter.  Central, acentral, spurious, inner or outer.  Take your pick.  </p>
<p>The Orders appear to your eyes, as they once did mine, as land floating through an infinite <a href="The_Wanderway.html">sky</a>.  One, a deathscape.  Yet another, an <a href="Necesscitas_CruciC481tC4AB_NovC4AB.html">endless city</a>; a third, an endless rolling country, idyllic from afar, but made entirely of worms, rot, and <a href="Water-Free_Water.html">lies</a>.  </p>
<p>These are accidents, not <i>essence</i>.  We live as bacteria upon the back of a dust speck to the world which once was.  The Orders are bastions against chaos, pieces of that world preserved through use of the Strictures against the timeless march of <a href="Wrathrunes.html">entropy</a>.  Perhaps the World That Was underwent some failure of existence.  Perhaps it did not.  But now we live in a pale shadow of former glory.  </p>
<p>What I have learned has worried me.  The Breaching Stricture works against the integrity of a thought, mind, concept... anything that can be thought of as having coherent structure.  Opening holes within it... For it to <a href="The_Twelve_Strictures_for_Self_Assured_Safety.html">fall</a> is both self-referential and troubling.  What is next? The <a href="The_Binding_Stricture.html" class="phantom">Binding Stricture</a> should bind<i> itself</i>?  </p>
<p>The Breaching Stricture also seems to have special power and association with a specific type of pants that stop at or around the knees.  I'm not really sure why this is.  </p>
<p>My battle with the <a href="The_Piercing_Stricture.html">Piercing Stricture</a> has left me wounded and my mind and memory with a few gaping holes, but though I had to <a href="Necesscitas_CruciC481tC4AB_NovC4AB.html">consume most of the population of the Central Order to do it</a>. I have emerged intact, though not unscathed.  Damn <a href="The_Bear_Inquisition.html">bears</a>.  </p>
<p>There is something or someone within the Order, in the institution known as Strictures United which I cannot for all my power touch.  It is vast and powerful, but a created thing.  I sense the strictures upon it but it is not of them.  There is a <a href="FaceSpace3A_New_Notifications.html">woman</a> <a href="Journal_Entry.html">who</a> <a href="An_Apology_-_from_Strictures_United.html">seems</a> a locus of this power.  Who - what, indeed - <i>is</i> she? </p>
<p>Another note on this person who seems to all the unknowing as a mere intern/vice president/whatever: </p>
<p>The odd numbered strictures refer to aspects of reality (or unreality). Piercing, breaching, leeching... have you not noticed, dear ones, that all the <i>even numbered Strictures imply destruction</i>?  <b><a href="Satan.html" class="phantom">What</a> is it that they were meant to destroy?</b></p>
<p>Think on this next time you speak with the Summers girl.  </p>
