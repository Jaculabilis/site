<h1>Reticular transcendence</h1>
<p>Gawd, I <i>hate</i> <b>reticular transcendence</b>. You'd think that ripping an event out of the causal fabric of reality would just make it go away, but <i>noooooo</i>, ever since the <a href="The_Happenstancening.html">'stancening</a> there've just been these, damnable, <i>ghosts</i> of the Before-Times, all floatin' around, being <i>visible</i> and suchlike. Where does an event free of the causal web of the universe get off interacting with my face eyes? I couldn't even go to the bar last night because everything was closed on account of <a href="Missing_Files.html">reticular echoes blocking the roads</a>. What a dump <a href="Grampul_Subsection_3.html">this excuse for an Order</a> is. I know this is the where the last Scriptorium is, but sometimes I feel like it's just not worth saving, y'know? Like it'd be nice to take a vacation in <a href="The_Order_which_is_Definitely_Not_Central.html">hell</a> to be somewhere <i>nice</i> for once. Hey, barkeep, gimme another, uh, Etna Fire.</p>
<p>Anyway, wheres was I? Right, the causality ghosts. So obnoxious. And even worse, some <a href="Typhus_Stormbreaker.html"><i>maniacs</i></a> have been trying to get the <a href="The_Binding_Stricture.html" class="phantom">Binding Stic... Sterc... Sonnuvabitch</a> back online so they can stricturize the reticular echoes back into reality. But cuz there can't be more than seven, or twelve, or whatever the hell the number is, they're just giving them <a href="Existence.html">negative ordinals</a>. How stupid is that? Why do we even want the reticular echoes back? I can't even punch my way out of this problem, because almost everything involved is virtual or figurative. This is the lamest post-apocalypse ever. Here I was, secretly hoping for civilization to descend into an orgy of violence so the Aquiline Order could go back to its roots, and instead I've got nothing to do but drink multi-dimensional beers and glare at the paranoid across the room rambling and covering everything in tinfoil.</p>
<p>St. Annihilatrix help me, maybe I really <i>do</i> need to take a vacation in hell. At least the ghosts are <i>supposed</i> to be there. Hey, barkeep...</p>
