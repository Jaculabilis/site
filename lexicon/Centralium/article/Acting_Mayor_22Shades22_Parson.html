<h1>Acting Mayor "Shades" Parson</h1>
<p>When you see as much as I do you make enemies of all sorts of powerful entities even and including the almost-all-seeing <a href="Strictures_United.html">Strictures United</a>. But even they are blind and have showed their <a href="FaceSpace3A_New_Notifications.html">hand</a> and not only that but also I've intercepted one of their communiques that they pass in the odd month editions of SUpper Home Cooking Magazines and it would appear they have been foiled in their most recent attempt to <a href="The_Binding_Stricture.html" class="phantom">Stricturize</a> our horribly corrupt mayor* into a mayor in their pocket which means that there are still corrupt politicians who are looking to resist and that may mean that there is hope for us to keep the Central Order from falling as <a href="The_Order_which_is_Definitely_Not_Central.html">so many have</a>. There are not many corrupt politicians left and so it is of vital importance that Mr. Parson stay corrupt and out of the control of Strictures.</p>
