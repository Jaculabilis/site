<h1>Letter on the Great Corruption</h1>

<p>"Guard always your hearts and minds from the influence of corruption and the truth will never betray you."-Sayings of the Fangbearers</p>
<p>From: Ursinquisitor Thelemas Tier</p>
<p>Greetings Blessed Chamberlain of All Fury,</p>
<p>I have further news of the events unfolding regarding the rebirth of the Eternal Strictures and the destruction of the <a href="The_Happenstancening.html" class="phantom">Happenstanceing</a>. In one of my travels I was momentarily distracted from my meditative navigation by a strange ripple in the Aether. It appears that a certain human female monastery is located on an intersection of the <a href="Great_Bear27s_Veins.html" class="phantom">Great Bear's Veins</a> and focuses the power of that ancient confluence to a distracting degree.</p>
<p>Oweing to the distraction and my broken trance state, I exited the Aether at highspeed above this monastery where I was confronted by a certain Sister Avacillata. She appears to have mistaken the last traces of my Wrathtrance for hostility, as she approached with a raised voice and firearm. I quickly disabled her with a single motion of the Bone Way and after some time we were able to speak together more peacefully.</p>
<p>According to the good Sister, it appears that the calamity that we have heard of did indeed strike humanity some two years previous, though the Ordus was, as you know, spared. Perhaps it is due to the Ordus having sworn off all use and knowledge of the ancient Scientific art, so their was no path for the corruption to flow into us.</p>
<p>I know not. That the calamity occurred at all, however concerns me greatly, in that it may imply--and I say this knowing full well the consequences of my words--a failure of the Great Strictures. If as the humans claim, their strictures suppressed the <a href="Science-Related_Memetic_Disorder.html">Scientific Corruption</a> from making itself known in them, for the calamity to occur may suggest the Eternal Strictures at the root of these human confabulations, perhaps flickered.</p>
<p>If this is heresy I pray absolve me of the corruption brought on by speaking with the human Sister, but I can not ignore any threat to The Ordus or the Eternal by which we roar and rage and have our being.</p>
<p>Humble in your service, and with great wrath to all corruption,</p>
