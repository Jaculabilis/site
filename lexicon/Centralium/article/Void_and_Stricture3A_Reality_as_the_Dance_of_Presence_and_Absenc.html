<h1>Void and Stricture: Reality as the Dance of Presence and Absence</h1>
<p>Presence looked at the damp knife in his hands and felt worried.</p>
<p>He walked over to the window and reflected on his futile surroundings. He had always loved vague Strictures Dance Ring with its salty, squealing Shining Dance Floors. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel worried.</p>
<p>Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Absence . Absence was a vile god with wobbly abs and sticky toes.</p>
<p>Presence gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was an intuitive, bold, bourbon drinker with slimy abs and chubby toes. His friends saw him as a vast, violet volcano. Fire in the eyes like <a href="Great_Bear27s_Veins.html" class="phantom">Great Bear's Veins</a>. Once, he had even helped a decomposing baby flamingo cross the road.</p>
<p>But not even an intuitive person who had once helped a decomposing baby flamingo cross the road, was prepared for what Absence had in store today.</p>
<p>The wind blew like jogging owls, aromas of <a href="Earthson27s_Bar_and_Grill.html">Earthson's Bar and Grill</a> flew in from the distance, making Presence jumpy.</p>
<p>As Presence stepped outside and Absence came closer, he could see the vague glint in his eye.</p>
<p>"I am here because I want a dance," Absence bellowed, in a brave tone. He slammed his fist against Presence's chest, with the force of 4102 snakes. "I frigging hate you, Presence ."</p>
<p>Presence looked back, even more jumpy and still fingering the damp knife. "Absence, reality is vague and futile," he replied.</p>
<p>They looked at each other with anxious feelings, like two racid, real rabbits drinking at a very snooty Flamenco Dance-Off, which had classical music playing in the background and two callous uncles alongside <a href="Cathyr_Van_Sacrilege.html">Cathyr Van Sacrilege</a> bopping to the beat.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Absence lunged forward and tried to punch Presence in the face. Quickly, Presence grabbed the damp knife and brought it down on Absence's skull.</p>
<p>Absence's wobbly abs trembled and his sticky toes wobbled. He looked puzzled, his body raw like a grisly, gorgeous gun.</p>
<p>Then he let out an agonising groan and collapsed onto the ground. Moments later Absence was dead.</p>
<p>Presence went back inside and made himself a nice drink of bourbon.</p>
