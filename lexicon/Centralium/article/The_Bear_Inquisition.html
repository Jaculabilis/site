<h1>The Bear Inquisition</h1>
<p>Talking with Q had left me with a lot of questions and a pounding headache where my memory of the conversation should be.  I knew <a href="Strictures_United.html">Strictures United</a> was employing <a href="Zetta_Computing.html">mad logomancers</a> to awake the <a href="An_Apology_-_from_Strictures_United.html">Thirteenth Stricture</a> for some <a href="Earthson27s_Bar_and_Grill.html">nefarious reason</a>.  But I was realizing that the intricacies of this case were about to flutter over my head like a butterfly with a superiority complex.  I  didn't know anything about Logomancy.  That meant I needed to talk to the nun-scholars of the Scriptorium.</p>
<p>Rubbing the back of my head, I strolled to the ancient campus, glancing appreciatively at the ivy-covered stone.  That lasted all of four seconds before I heard <a href="The_Wanderway.html">needles ricocheting off the building next to me</a>.  I swore and dove for cover.  I'd almost made it when two tons of furry fury tore through the fabric of space like a St. Bernard that didn't see the screen door, bowling me over so hard it knocked the wind out of my next of kin.  The Ursinquisitor pulled out of a roll, rising up on its hind legs and bellowing at the sky, twelve feet of muscle rippling under its engraved armor and luscious fur.</p>
<p>The Bear Inquisition was a mysterious organization.  <a href="Greetings_to_the_High_Chamberlain.html">Fanatically devoted to the Strictures</a> and <a href="Letter_on_the_Great_Corruption.html">opposed to mad science in its entirety</a>, little was known of its inner workings by those outside of it.  They were based out of the <a href="Unnamed_City.html">Unnamed City</a>, and supposedly protecting something important inside, but the details never made it out—partly because the other thing the Bear Inquisition did was travel the land and stomp out people who share those kinds of details.  When an Ursinquisitor arrived, anyone with sense ran away.</p>
<p>"Alright, you oversized rodent!" yelled an elderly nun, advancing across the green and holding the bear in the sights of a monster shotgun.  "Back off unless you want an extra ear hole!"</p>
<p>The sight of the gun seemed to enrage the bear even further.  I held perfectly still.  It'd be okay unless he started chanting the Strictures.</p>
<p>"<a href="The_Piercing_Stricture.html">Pierce and cut<br>
Stab and slice<br>
But build ye not<br>
A grand Device!</a>" he roared, and in a flash he'd ripped the gun from her hands and crumpled it into scrap.</p>
<p>Shit.</p>
<p>I muffled a groan of pain and starting pulling my bruised body under the bushes, which is the only logical response when an Ursinquitor starts chanting the Strictures.  But apparently the five foot tall, eighty-year-old nun was not logical, because she cracked her knuckles and said with a gleam in her eye, "The bullets hurt less."</p>
<p>Her first punch lifted the bear off the ground.  Before gravity could do its wicked work, she'd leapt into the air and kicked him back down.  But instead of breaking his spine in the fall, the Ursinquisitor rolled with the fall and came up swinging.  The nun blocked or dodged several attacks before the bear lifted her up by her habit and drop-kicked her through the window of the library.</p>
<p>A stream of curses emanated from the broken window.  The Urisinquisitor snarled and leapt through the broken window.  A very loud and deep <i>thud</i> escaped the the window, followed immediately by a yelp and shortly after by the bear himself.  A voice within the library shouted, "Wait, Sister Avacillata, you can't just—" but was cut off when Sister Avacillata emerged at the window wielding an entire bookcase above her head.</p>
<p>"You like the Strictures?" she shouted.  "<b>Then it's time for some book learnin'!</b>"</p>
<p>I'd never heard a bear cry for his mother before.</p>
