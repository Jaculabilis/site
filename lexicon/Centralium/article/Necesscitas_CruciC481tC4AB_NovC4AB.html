<h1>Necesscitas Cruciātī Novī</h1>
<p>Communique 48:// #subsector 5, High Office Chamberlain</p>
<p>AethID 23449-84:/ CalypsoNet</p>
<p>"Take heed always to tear out corruption wherever it may spring up, for if you should not, and it take root, the Wrathbears will descend in a tide of death and fury to wash away the stain of heresy with the blood of the unworthy." Greater Chatechism of Wrath, Author Unknown</p>
<p>From: Ursinquisitor Thelemas Tier</p>
<p>Greetings Blessed Chamberlain of All Fury,</p>
<p>I have expressed my concern in the past several missives regarding the supposed "creation" of Strictures and the attitude of rampant carelessness expressed by many in this portion of the Aetherverse. </p>
<p>I have just now discovered things are far worse than I could have imagined, and as such must make this formal request.</p>
<p>In recent weeks the organization and Planet-city known as the Central Order has continued in their bullheaded attempts to maximize their own profitability at the expense of Reality itself, in service of their cold <a href="Religion_28disambiguation29.html">religion</a> of greed.  I have previously mentioned the so called <a href="An_Apology_-_from_Strictures_United.html">"Thirteenth Stricture</a>, but it was unknown to me until this time that the Central Order has created this perverse <a href="Logomancy.html" class="phantom">amalgamation of Science and The Eternal</a> by use of <a href="White_Lab_Coats.html">Soul-Wounded Scientists</a>.</p>
<p>If this were the extent of their crimes, I would still see fit to make the request which is forthcoming, but to the sorrow of all, there is yet more.</p>
<p>It has come to my attention, that beyond some paltry--however heretical and abominable it may be--and deliberate attempt to bend the Eternal Strictures to their own whims, the Central Order has been a source of Aetheric Corruption, the <a href="Strictures_United.html">black smoke of foulness</a> wafting from it out into the void, kept hidden by mankind to some nefarious end. The Central Order itself has in fact become an abomination, a rotting pustule in the core of the Aetherverse. Perhaps it is for this reason that the Aether has become <a href="The_Wanderway.html">warped in certain places</a> </p>
<p>On account of these dreadful tidings, and with a heavy heart I therefore make this request:</p>
<p>Blessed High Chamberlain of All Fury, Wrath of the Eternal, Bloodclaw and Render of Deceit, </p>
<p>Your servant,  Brother Thelemas Tier, Ursinquisitor, 3rd Order of the Blooded Claw and Penitent of All Mysteries does request formally and with sober mind and spirit, a Great Crusade. Let the fury of the Ursinquisitus rain down upon the unrighteous, let the blood of the unworthy wash away the stink of heresy from mankind, let the rot and corruption of the Central Order be purged in a great conflagration as the Wrathbears descend to roar and destroy and bring woe to those who would conceal abomination in their midst and covet it to flourish.</p>
<p>Let a Cruciātus Novus, a new crusade, be formed to devour all that is unholy and to leave the ashes of purification in its wake. I request this, as such rage wells up in me as is mete and right, for the anger of the Eternal roars through me at the desecration of the Aetherverse.</p>
<p>I remain humble in your service, and with great wrath to all corruption,</p>
<hr><span class="signature"><p>Brother Thelemas Tier, Ursinquisitor, 3rd Order of the Blooded Claw and Penitent of All Mysteries, Boneroarer of the 5th Great Crusade.</p></span>
