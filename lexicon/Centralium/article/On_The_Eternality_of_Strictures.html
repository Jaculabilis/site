<h1>On The Eternality of Strictures</h1>
<p><a href="Earthson27s_Bar_and_Grill.html">Earthson's Bar and Grill</a> is the only place of any safety left as <a href="Strictures_United.html">Strictures United</a> has raided my <a href="White_Lab_Coats.html">apartment</a> knowing that I knew too much and therefore attempting to take me out of the picture but the resistance movement let me know in a final communique provided by the logo on a SUmmer Vacation Planning pamphlet* warning me of an oncoming SUrprise raid on my apartment. I feel oh so very sorry for whoever was first through the door and highly doubt they remember what year it is.^ I sit in the grill with closed doors open to all with a recent covering of tin foil to keep the thrice damned <a href="Logomancy.html" class="phantom">logomancers</a> <a href="White_Lab_Coats.html">employed by SU</a>. They cannot get us here so long as Earthson remains and the man remains vigilant against all forces of man and bear and infernal being.</p>
<p>After covering the bar with tin foil and unplugging all computer terminals and phone outlets to ensure we would not be spied upon I had some time to pass and I looked at the various books and tomes stored in the rooms of the bar and after passing over archived copies of <a href="Strictures_United_Quarterly_Financial_Update.html">SU Quarterly Reports</a> and Liber Ivonis and a compendium of non-euclidean beer brewing techniques and a very strange set of scholarly reports circling around some apocalypse in another dimension and time I picked up a strange volume <i>On the Eternality of the Strictures</i> which was so completely and utterly boring that it fascinated and entertained me to no end.</p>
<p>The <a href="Grand_Executor_Jargan.html">first page</a> contained some small amount of information on the Strictures including the process by which one may bind the <a href="Strictures_United_Quarterly_Financial_Update.html">abstract to the concrete</a>. However after the first page` it launches into a manifesto of causal-breaking party crashing parties and I will say <a href="Grand_Executor_Jargan.html">Jargan</a> certainly knows how to throw a party and as the Grand Executor of such he has not only launched many parties but has been known to <i>literally</i> crash parties which has resulted in numerous floating stations filled with party-goers and business executives having a very untimely end and he even managed to sneak out of and therefore into a <a href="D.E.A.T.H.S.T.A.R..html">top secret strictures meeting</a>. From reading through his accomplishments and MO and general goal it is obvious and clear and beyond a doubt that he was involved in the collapse of the <a href="The_Breaching_Stricture.html">Breaching Stricture</a> and <a href="Seirapolis.html">Seirapolis</a> because after all what could ever possibly be a greater crash than this and what <a href="Grand_Executor_Jargan.html">sort of parties could he throw</a> in the chaos that ensued?</p>
<p>Some tin foil just got torn by that odd PI who has a bump on his head so I must repair the damage before it's too late.</p>

<p>^To be fair, neither does anyone else.</p>
<p>`The pages are approximately three feet by two feet, so one page does contain quite a bit of information.</p>
