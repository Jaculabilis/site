<h1>Journal Entry</h1>
<p><i>Dear Diary,</i></p>
<p><i>Things have gone wacko with the machines. I am so confused, like, what is even happening anymore? People were running around at work for a few days in <a href="White_Lab_Coats.html">white jackets</a> like totally crazy people, and then they like just stopped showing up for work. Things are going very weirdly - like <a href="The_Ministry_of_Not_Screwing_Things_Up.html">one day I'm an intern and the next I'm Vice President</a>?! I'm pretty sure that like the only way that I would have been offered this promotion is if <a href="The_Kappanstancing.html">everyone else died</a>.</i></p>
<p><i>Anyways, I'm like, trying to go through my new desk here and like... WOW. And do you think I don't have to still keep the front desk clean too? Well, I do. Luckily like, I already kept it pretty clean up there but like its a total mess in this office. I thought I was getting somewhere earlier when I found <a href="The_Laws_of_the_Strictures.html">these books</a> but after I arranged volumes 1-6, like, theres not even a volume 8 or 9 anywhere and then theres totally volumes 10-12 and no 13, then theres a 14, but no 15 & 16, and then there's 17-20. On top of all that, its supposed to be a 22 volume collection according to the back. Anyways, I'm not even going to read them because they look old, like, REALLY old, like they don't even have pictures and they're pages are GROSS like YELLOW TORN PAGES EVERYWHERE!</i></p>
<p><i>Either way, Diary, things are like totally nuts-o right now and I can't even.</i></p>
