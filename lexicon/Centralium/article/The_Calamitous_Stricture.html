<p><i>You are the survivors of the Happenstancening, trying to piece together how it was that the Seven Strictures failed the Central Order.</i></p>

<h1>The Calamitous Stricture</h1>
<p>The sobriquet "<b>The Calamitous Stricture</b>" is something of a misnomer. Any official statement of the Seven Strictures is accompanied by an apocalyptic warning about what will happen should the Strictures fail to be kept. It eventually became common to refer to this warning as the "Zeroth Stricture", and because the Seven have traditional titles along the pattern of "The &lt;Adjective&gt; Stricture", the Zeroth soon acquired the title of "The Calamitous Stricture", despite the fact that it is not a Stricture proper.</p>
<p>The nature of the disaster foretold in the Calamitous Stricture remained the subject of intense academic debate up until the Happenstancening. Until then, the prevailing hermeneutical theory had alleged that the references to <a href="Science-Related_Memetic_Disorder.html">SRMD</a> were metaphorical. When it did happen, this theory was suddenly and horrifyingly debunked. But I guess that's what happens when you let half-wits like the <i>esteemed</i> <a href="Vin2C_Vice_President_Carnold.html">Dr. Vin</a> run the <a href="The_Ministry_of_Not_Screwing_Things_Up.html">The Ministry of Not Screwing Things Up</a>. Being re-ensouled into a tech'd-up junker car after his untimely demise <i>clearly</i> didn't do wonders for his intellect, but somehow having no hands is the greater obstacle to his ability to do his job. Who'd have thought that you would need hands to operate the labyrinthine control panel of the Ministry's Dediscombobulator? Maybe <b>everyone who voted against him?</b></p>
<p>And let's not forget who's really responsible for this grand old mess we're in. I know it's rude to speak ill of the dead, but honestly, fuck 'em. So much of their middle management and executive corps died in the fallout of the Happenstancening that they've had to delegate <a href="An_Apology_-_from_Strictures_United.html">nearly everything</a> to their interns. Meanwhile, the surviving executives are collecting the pay of their fallen comrades. When will the iron fist of justice crush these reprobates? When will the Scriptorium approve my personal leave for unspecified, certainly non-vengeance reasons?</p>
<p>Forget this, I'm going to <a href="Earthson27s_Bar_and_Grill.html">Earthson's</a> to pick a fight with the aethercycle gangs.</p>
