<p><i>You are the survivors of the Happenstancening, trying to piece together how it was that the Seven Strictures failed the Central Order.</i></p>

<h1>Earthson's Bar and Grill</h1>
<p>It is not the finest dining establishment in the Orders, for that would imply a level of formality appropriate to "fine dining". It is not the cheapest, nor provides the largest portions, nor has it the most amenities, or the largest menu, or the most advanced facilities. Yet in the wake of the Happenstancening, when it seemed that time and space themselves were set against us, <b>Earthson's Bar and Grill</b> appeared in the <a href="Grampul_Subsection_3.html">Central Order</a> as if out of nowhere and became the best. In our time of need, this bar and its genial owner offered us a kind word, a knowing smile, and a heady beer. Somehow, when he tells us tales of his late wife, of worlds turned inside out, of horrors from beyond, everything seems like it will turn out alright. Or, at least, that's the only thing people remember about it &mdash; he only regales people who are too drunk to remember the details.</p>
<p>Earthson's is something of a refuge for the lost and dispossessed in Grampul. <a href="Vin2C_Vice_President_Carnold.html">VP Vin</a> (or should I say <i>Jeep</i> Vin? Ha!) hates the place with a passion, since with the lost and dispossessed comes no small amount of simmering unrest, bright-eyed revolutionaries, and down-and-out sons of the Orders with nothing to lose. Some evenings it seems there's a plot brewing in every booth. Word on the street is that Vin pressured ol' Strics U into <a href="The_Twelve_Strictures_for_Self_Assured_Safety.html">emptying the subsection</a> just to clear the place out. He can't move against it directly, of course. Not only is it all but holy ground for the common man here, the entrance to the place seems to change locations throughout the back streets of the Central Order. Rumors are the owner invented magic. It's not like we believe in magic in our enlightened and scientific age, but with everything else that's happened, why take the risk?</p>
<p>Still, some things about Earthson's seem to defy belief. Last night I had just finished debating an unhappy <a href="Happe.html">Happe</a> on a finer point of textual interpretation when I saw the owner sneak out into the back hallway. Knowing that there are no bathrooms back there, I released my interlocutor from the headlock and followed. The hallway curved with strange geometries, and I saw the owner pass by a series of doors, each marked with the name of an Order. He entered the door marked <a href="The_Order_which_is_Definitely_Not_Central.html">"ORD. DEF. NOT C."</a>. I snuck forward and peeked through, and the sight I beheld shook me to my core.</p>
<p>We all knew OWIDNC had taken the Happenstancening hard. We all knew that it might not even exist any more. But nothing could have prepared me to see Hell itself beyond that doorway, and all the hosts of the damned arrayed against the man who had just arrived. <a href="Satan.html">The Prince of Darkness himself</a> bellowed his challenge and raised a sword of purest darkness. I was about to run to my sisters back at the bar for aid when that man, standing tall in that pit where the fire is not quenched, looked back at me and winked. I fled, clutching my pectoral cross.</p>
<p>There wasn't enough Stout of Unknowing in the place for me to get any sleep that night.</p>
