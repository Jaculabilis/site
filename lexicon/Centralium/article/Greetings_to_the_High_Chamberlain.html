<p>"The Old Strictures are come again, and with faces altered like the rising of a different sun." -From the Prophecy of Brother Thanatos, Elder Clawbearer</p>
<p>From: Ursinquisitor Thelemas Tier</p>
<p>Greetings Blessed Chamberlain of All Fury,</p>
<p>I write this missive to explain my absence from the Great Den for this past many months and to inform Your Excellency of a discovery which, if it is borne out in all truth and zeal, does promise to affect great revelation upon both the <a href="The_Bear_Inquisition.html" class="phantom">Ordos Urinquisitus</a> as well as the various subsections.</p>
<p>I have been searching out the truth of the so called <a href="The_Latitant_Macrophobic_Limaciform_Stricture.html">"Great LaMaLi" Stricture</a>, to test whether it is indeed one of the Old Strictures come again.
I am as of yet unsure, given the curious nature of this creature. 
As Father Marquette often wrote, <a href="On_The_Eternality_of_Strictures.html" class="phantom">"Strictures may appear in the unlikeliest of places, and in forms and features strange and wonderful to behold. Test, therefore, each one, to see by the purity of your heart and the ringing of your soul whether it be the Eternal come again into time, or it be corruption given flesh and word."</a></p>
<p>As you well know, the Ordos has maintained the Sayings of the Great Fore-Bears for generations, and the wisdom in them has not been lost to darkness. For this reason I believe that although Strictures United considers themselves to have developed the Strictures, they are merely putting into modern tongue the Eternal Stricture Which Was Without End. Perhaps they do this unconsciously, inspired by a deep truth they themselves do not understand, but the Eternal moves in them. And in the case of the LaMaLi, perhaps it is as Father Marquette proclaimed, and the Eternal Stricture has manifest itself in flesh rather than in word.</p>
<p>This is, of course, excluding the accursed and so called <a href="An_Apology_-_from_Strictures_United.html">"13th Stricture,"</a> a perversion of the Eternal for the benefit of mankind, may it be torn asunder by tooth and claw.</p>
<p>I will continue to write as the truth is made clear to me.</p>
<p>Humble in your service, and with great wrath to all corruption,</p>
<hr><span class="signature"><p> Brother Thelemas Tier,
