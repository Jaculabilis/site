<h1>Water-Free Water</h1>
<p>Are you water-free and tired of dealing with the problems that come with it? Well, good news for all you sea-liacs out there, because a crack team of <a href="White_Lab_Coats.html">genuine, reliable researchers</a> has created a product that will blow your minds!</p>
<p>Did you know? Of the 23 self-identifying H2Obophobes who responded to the survey, 39% said they were against water for ethical reasons. "A poet writes of a lake of ice in the deepest layer of hell," one surveyor stated, "Mix that with the firey upper half and what do you get? The <a href="Satan.html" class="phantom">devil's</a> liquid."</p>
<p>It breaks my heart to know that many these people are living with serious conditions, such as dry-mouth syndrome or simply dying of dehydration. But all these problems are about to be solved forever, with the unveiling of our new miracle product, Water-Free Water!</p>
<p>What did you say? Water-Free Water? How is that even possible? By harnessing the power of <a href="The_Wanderway.html">aetheric currents</a>, researchers were able to isolate the core essence of not-water-ness and infuse it into this revolutionary new beverage. Our manufacturing process is completely natural; some believe <a href="Happe.html">primitive species</a> were exploiting it even before the <a href="The_Happenstancening.html">'Stancening</a>.</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for? If you're experiencing any of the issues I mentioned, or if you just want to get in on the hottest new drink, get some Water-Free Water today!</p>
<p>Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm a little thirsty. I think I'll just grab a bottle of... hey, you're not still recording, are you?</p>
