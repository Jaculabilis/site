# Title: The Twelve Strictures for Self Assured Safety

[[They say|Vin, Vice President Carnold]] the [[Fourth|The Breaching Stricture]] fell first.  That was suspicious, since you'd expect things to stay sane until the [[First|The Binding Stricture]] went down.  I'm no academic, but I had the next best thing.

Ol' Jonah lazily slung my scotch along the sticky countertop like an elephant swats a fly with its tail.  We went way back; I'd had his back when the Central Order had deployed us to deconvert those damned [[Happe]] from their apocalypse cult.  He says he doesn't blame me for the spear that took his leg, but he lets me drink myself to death anyways.

Ol' Jonah didn't move much anymore, but he heard everything.  And I didn't like what he'd heard tonight.

"Strictures United is trying to distance itself from the disaster," he said.  "They're [[pretending there's always been twelve Strictures|An Apology - from Strictures United]], not to mention adding a 'Thirteenth' that washes their hands of all this."

I glanced at the document he flashed me.

"Shit," I said, recognizing Andrew Carnelian's signature on the memo.  He was the president of Strictures United, every bit the handsome executive: respectable grey hair, commanding build, eyes like a butcher's cleaver and teeth like a shark.  "They're just gonna pretend the Central Order doesn't exist anymore?"

"President Carnelian seems pretty firm about it," said Ol' Jonah.

I grimaced.  The devout recite the Strictures every day.  The craziest of them take them literally instead of as useful guidelines.  If that Thirteenth Stricture went through, Strictures United was going to cause a mass migration out of the Central Order.  People were already on their back foot in here, but the flood of refugees would cause the entire Central Order to collapse.  Most of them would have nowhere to go.

"How much for the document?"

"A gift for an old friend."

"Sure," I said.  I overpaid him for my scotch, snatched the document, and slunk out into the rainy night.

So, the president of Strictures United was trying to empty out the subsection.

What was he trying to hide?
