# Title: Logomancy

Developed by EGI in 2029, **logomancy** has since become a matter of speculation and General Intrigue. 

Following Vandal Von Doomsday’s [[discovery of the Terminal Void|Strictures United Quarterly Financial Update]] in 2028, he wrote the //Stricturnomicon//, providing a detailed account of [["the blessing"|Science-Related Memetic Disorder]] of the [["nameless force"|The Unwritten Stricture]]. The //Stricturnomicon// was set into seven sections, each of which was divided into fifty-three sub-sections, separated into eighteen "letters," most of which were love letters written to a "Polly" who claimed she seduced [["the devil hisself"|Satan]]. While this "Polly" since been surpassed by [[Heimrond Von Nazi III|The Unwritten Stricture]], she maintained her unbounded sapience. Mystically impregnated by this "Polly," Vandal Von Doomsday returned to "the surface." Seeing the book as worth saving, but also worth being unread, the Scriptorium built much of its library from copies of the book. It is estimated that at least 9,999,999,999{error} volumes went into the bricks. In 2029 EGI acquired the remaining two legible copies of the //Stricturnomicon// and developed the science of **logomancy** from the dark wisdom therein. 

Since 2029, the methods of **logomancy** have changed, possibly due to the general incoherency of Vandal Von Doomsday's text and the [[madness|The Fellowship of the Living Word]] usually resulting from he former style. This madness can be evaded by being a library. Most modern **logomancy** is performed via [[flamenco dancing|Flamenco Dance-Off]]. Oddly enough, the algorithmic method used for this is directly born of--literally //birthed by//--[[the blessing|Strictures United Quarterly Financial Update]]. Further, according to [[the Ursinquisitors|Necesscitas Cruciātī Novī]], the Thirteenth Stricture was itself created by the "use" of [[man scientists|White Lab Coats]]. [[**Logomancy** can not pass through tin foil|On The Eternality of Strictures]] according to [[Carnelian's memos|White Lab Coats]].

According to General Intruigue, the bastard father of Vandal Von Doomsday, **Logomancy** is "both the mother and child of the Strictures." This is worth considering.
