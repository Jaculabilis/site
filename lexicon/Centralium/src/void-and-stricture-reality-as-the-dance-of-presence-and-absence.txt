# Title: Void and Stricture: Reality as the Dance of Presence and Absence

Presence looked at the damp knife in his hands and felt worried.

He walked over to the window and reflected on his futile surroundings. He had always loved vague Strictures Dance Ring with its salty, squealing Shining Dance Floors. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel worried.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Absence . Absence was a vile god with wobbly abs and sticky toes.

Presence gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was an intuitive, bold, bourbon drinker with slimy abs and chubby toes. His friends saw him as a vast, violet volcano. Fire in the eyes like [[Great Bear's Veins]]. Once, he had even helped a decomposing baby flamingo cross the road.

But not even an intuitive person who had once helped a decomposing baby flamingo cross the road, was prepared for what Absence had in store today.

The wind blew like jogging owls, aromas of [[Earthson's Bar and Grill]] flew in from the distance, making Presence jumpy.

As Presence stepped outside and Absence came closer, he could see the vague glint in his eye.

"I am here because I want a dance," Absence bellowed, in a brave tone. He slammed his fist against Presence's chest, with the force of 4102 snakes. "I frigging hate you, Presence ."

Presence looked back, even more jumpy and still fingering the damp knife. "Absence, reality is vague and futile," he replied.

They looked at each other with anxious feelings, like two racid, real rabbits drinking at a very snooty Flamenco Dance-Off, which had classical music playing in the background and two callous uncles alongside [[Cathyr Van Sacrilege]] bopping to the beat.

Suddenly, Absence lunged forward and tried to punch Presence in the face. Quickly, Presence grabbed the damp knife and brought it down on Absence's skull.

Absence's wobbly abs trembled and his sticky toes wobbled. He looked puzzled, his body raw like a grisly, gorgeous gun.

Then he let out an agonising groan and collapsed onto the ground. Moments later Absence was dead.

Presence went back inside and made himself a nice drink of bourbon.
