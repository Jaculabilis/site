# Title: The Kappanstancing

The establishment thought they could silence the me from speaking the horrible truth they have hidden from the PEOPLE. Those have fiends have established the strictures, well known to all. But they have a secret set of strictures that have evolved, grown into something completely imaginary, the COMPLEX STRICTURES. I have said repeatedly the Happenstancening was an inside job, but what was not known was that it was a stricture itself set up by non other than [[Cathyr Van Sacrilege]]. The public does not know about it because it is a part of the imaginary set of strictures that's right they intentionally stricturized the Happenstancening making it become part of the fabric of reality we tread upon!

But for every complex number* there is a complex conjugate and The Happenstancening is no exception. The Kappanstancing is the equal opposite which came about from the society that relayed this information to me via encoded messages in the ingredients section of SUpe cans which indeed [[neutralized|Journal Entry]] the villains in Strictures United and they could only have discovered how to [[manipulate reality|Ontological Abstractions and How to Beat Them to Death]] in such a way which would explain why [[Earthson's Bar and Grill]] is under [[siege|Missing Files]]. How else do you think Vice President Vin met such a [[demise|The Calamitous Stricture]]? Wake up sleepers!

*Of course this is a complex stricture, its effects are real and therefore it does indeed have a real part as well as its imaginary part.
