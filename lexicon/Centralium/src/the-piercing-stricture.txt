"Pierce and cut\\
Stab and slice\\
But build ye not\\
A grand Device!"

Utter these words only in time of great peril, for the speaking of the Stricture shall pierce through all that is unworthy, as the blade passes between the bone and the flesh." --On Purity Regarding the Use of Battle Strictures, Brother Lantitum the Vengeful

From: Ursinquisitor Thelemas Tier of the 5th Great Crusade

Greetings Blessed Chamberlain of All Fury,

The beginning of the Great 5th Crusade is underway. As I mentioned in a previous communique, there is tremendous corruption and unrest spreading from the Central Order and in fact I now have reason to believe that the corruption has become concentrated to lethal levels and [[wiped out most of the population|Journal Entry]] of the Central Order.

In some ways this heresy is the root of its own undoing, but I fear that this outbreak of Aetherial filth will now spread unhindered by whatever machinations were previously put in place by the [[Soul Wounded|White Lab Coats]]. It is time to bring flame and the purity of ash to this world.

Because of the dire situation that presents itself, I was forced in a moment of great catastrophe to utter the Piercing Stricture.

I am of course aware of the restrictions and limitations placed on such an evocation, given the risk posed to one's [[purity of soul|The Unwritten Stricture]], I deemed it necessary. 
Accordingly I uttered The Stricture, and evoked the Deep Word it contains and names, in order pierce the essential structure of an enemy weapon of great power. It was then a simple matter to shatter it with my bare claws and destroy it utterly. I would not have done this, save that the weapon was crafted with technology and stank of Science.

After the events resolved and I returned to safety I began the ritual prayers and ablutions to cleanse my soul of the taint of the [[Void|Void and Stricture: Reality as the Dance of Presence and Absence]]. Fortunately my armour remained mostly unharmed from the activation of the Stricture, thanks to the [[Wrathrunes]] placed upon it by Brother Fulmaethor. As usual, they held at bay the corruption coiled and loosed by the use of a Stricture.

There is a curiosity that has grown in my mind for some time and given me no peace such that it requires me to lay it bare before you now. How is it that the Strictures, which hold corruption and chaos and the void at bay, upon their use expose one to those same elements? It seems blasphemous to suggest, but the simplest explanation seems to me to be that the directed use and evocation of a stricture somehow negates it for a moment in a specific targeted way. As if the stricture were suspended momentarily and in a small area. 
This leads me to a strange thought and fear: perhaps the Great Destruction was not intentional. Perhaps it was the result of a greed for power, and the Strictures being used as weapons of war.
If we are to wage this Crusade against corruption, how are we to avoid the unleashing of a greater corruption yet?
Please forgive my doubts and absolve me of any heretical thoughts.

I remain humble in your service, and with great wrath to all corruption,

~Brother Thelemas Tier, Ursinquisitor, 3rd Order of the Blooded Claw and Penitent of All Mysteries, Boneroarer of the 5th Great Crusade.
