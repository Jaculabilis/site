# Title: Strictures United Quarterly Financial Update

Normally I wouldn't read something so boring as a quarterly financial update, and I take it that any man or woman of good sense wouldn't either, but as a Scriptorium scribe, I have to attend to the whole text in order to copy it. Because of this, I have made the horrifying discovery that [[Strictures United]] has been publishing their evil plans in plain sight, a fact unrealized until now, as nobody has ever bothered to read one of these. Take heed of the attached document.

~STRICTURES UNITED\\
Q2 3014

Ladies and gentlemen, it has been another successful quarter for Strictures United. As is our tradition in Q2 financial updates, I will review our secret plans.

As you know, our mission began with Vandal Von Doomsday's discovery in 2028 of the Terminal Void beneath our Central Order. There he communed with an eldritch and nameless force and received [[its blessing|Science-Related Memetic Disorder]]. He returned from his sojourn and wrote the //Stricturnomicon//, a record of all his dark wisdom. Fortunately, the blessing of the Terminal Void remained on the fringes, never a threat to the continued existence of human civilization. Nevertheless, we took action, knowing that this peace was only the [[existence]] within the Void biding its time. Through our shell company, Evil Goods Incorporated, we acquired all known copies of the //Stricturnomicon//, studied Von Doomsday's dark wisdom, and developed the science of [[logomancy]] in order to bind the darkness forever.

With the power of Von Doomsday guided by the wisdom of logomancy, we created [[the Binding Stricture]], the first and greatest of our creations, which would allow us to bind the abstract to the corporeal. We tested the limits of our newfound powers, both binding to [[something that already existed|The Ministry of Not Screwing Things Up]] as well as [[creating something anew|The Latitant Macrophobic Limaciform Stricture]]. Finally, with confidence in our abilities, we sent the Binding Stricture with EGI's last expedition to the Terminal Void, and there bound the various aspects of the darkness within six new Strictures: in their [[current order|Harvey Gardell]], the Leeching, Reversing, Breaching, Cleaving, Piercing, and Unwritten Strictures.

Would that this were the end of the story. Not a year after we wrapped up our clandestine activities and [[shut down EGI|Strictures United]], the evil we had bound stirred in its sleep, breaching all of our defenses and infecting //everyone// with SRMD. In a panic, we released our Strictures to walk among the people, in the hopes that their passive binding effects would prevent utter disaster. When the Seven began to be insufficient, we released even our prototypes. This stemmed the tide, until two years ago. While we were attempting to use [[yotta computing|Zetta Computing]] to discover more about the unnamed darkness, it stirred again, which disrupted the Seven's daily [[flamenco parade|Flamenco Dance-Off]] through the streets of the Central Order. The Fourth tripped and fell onto the Seiropolis, breaching the containment (we suspect [[sabotage|Vin, Vice President Carnold]]). In the mess that followed, [[things generally went to hell|The Happenstancening]].

This, of course, has been no obstacle to our plans. With our new zetta computing paradigm, we will finally be able to merge the Terminal Void existence with our new [[Thirteenth Stricture|An Apology - from Strictures United]]. As long as the evil bound within the Seven doesn't [[leak out|The Piercing Stricture]], our victory is assured, and this will all have been worth it.

//Sincerely,//\\
Andrew Carnelian\\
President of Strictures United
