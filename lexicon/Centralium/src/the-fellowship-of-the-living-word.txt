# Title: The Fellowship of the Living Word

War... war never changes.  

Until the part where you break out some KICKASS POWER ARMOR and go a RAMPAGING THROUGH THE STREETS of [[WHERE THE FUCK EVER|Grampul Subsection 3]]!  

BOOYAH! 

With a couple exceptions they don't let you out of the Fellowship until you've achieved [[rulership|The King's Altitude]], so the last couple hundred of us are Lucin's World natives ever since that transporter accident with Original Eurythian and Von Doomsday.  That //apparently// means that when one of us merges with the Archives in the Scriptorium and the other consumes half a million orphans it tends to //do// things to you.  Like unnatural speed and this weird hunger for people's gall bladders.  For me it's the gall bladder, I know Eddie here prefers liver.  

Anyway as a devout Noted Scholar (third class, rank upsilon) it's my job to kick some [[bear asses|The Bear Inquisition]] and chew orphan-soul gum. And the entire world has nearly run out of orphans (well, until recently that is).  

This would be a bit more of a shitshow but for two major reasons (other than the whole 'powered by forsaken children' thing of course).  

1. Bruh, we've been [[embedded in Strictures United|D.E.A.T.H.S.T.A.R.]] since the [[abject failure|Unnamed City]] that was the 3rd Crusade.  

2. I kind of forgot what 2. was gonna be because like, the Leeching Stricture just kicked in and 

3. o yea we stole Stricture based [[logomancy|Logomancy]] from SU, which would USUALLY drive you totally nutso to use the way we been using but like, when your psychic register links right to a sapient library it can kinda offload the madness into random gibberish and offshunted energies that cause [[spontaneous surprise parties|Grand Executor Jargan]].  Mostly.  

4. Of course since the most SURPRISING party is one in which your gall bladder is suddenly and generously donated to a kind, scholarly Noted Scholar over here, 

6. goddamn I'm hungry.

5. and you are full of blood and meat and electricity and fats, fatty acids, amniotic fluids and chyme and synovia and dreams and hopes and rage and lymph 

8. stuff and fill and glut and swallow chew consume drink leech slurp gulp swallow

9. rip n tear rip n tear RIP AND TEAR RIP AND TEAR RIP AND TEAR

9. YOU ARE A BEAR THAT MEANS YOU HAVE HUGE GUTS

9. RIP AND TEAR YOUR GUTS

Sorry.  That probably wasn't very scholarly.  Thought it certainly was uh, surprising.  bears dont go down easy i tell u that.  For some reason the Happe go down even harder.  Should look into recruiting them or sommat.  

Fuck this place is going down the tubes.  The Ascended is moving off, so we beat a retreat - LET the bears have the Central Order.  What's left here anyway?  

We've got an even juicier target all swollen with blood and sebum and cerebral-spinal fluid.  Left alone by the Order ever since the Unwritten Stricture rendered it [[unnameable|Unnamed City]].  

It sure was nice of SU to [[relocate all our deep-cover embedded agents to Bear Central|Seirapolis]].  The Scriptorium thinks that [[there's something big and juicy inside|Unnamed City]].  Something that maybe the Ascended can eat.  Maybe.  

But best of all, it boasts the largest orphanage of ANYWHERE.
