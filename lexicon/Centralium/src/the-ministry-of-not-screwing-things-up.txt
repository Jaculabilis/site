# Title: The Ministry of Not Screwing Things Up

**The Ministry of Not Screwing Things Up**, from the Latin, //quae in ministerium non futuit sursum//, literally, "which is in the has sex with the service is not up," "the attendance of not penetrating above," and "which is in service have sex with him." Though scholars have translated this forth and back, back and forth, the multiplicity of meanings continues to this very hour. The last rendering has been accepted as computer error. It makes no sense. 

In the early 14th century it was the task of this ministry to a) penalize any man who had sex at a greater present elevation than the king and b) to enact //vetitum prolis// on any man who elevated his lover above the current elevation of the king. 

Needless to say, the ministry became inactive around the time that kings began succumbing to [[SRMD|Science-Related Memetic Disorder]] and began playing a role not unlike that of referee between science-people and religion-people. They began to die off shortly after, somewhat. Some remained until a time long remembered.

It was particularly important in those days to live, literally, beneath the king, or at the very least to procreate beneath him. This was true also of queens, sometimes, maybe, though they tended to be severely less strict. It was not uncommon then to live underground, especially if prone to sudden romp-rompings-in-the-hay, sweet-whoopy-makings, in-out-in-out-lovings, so on and etc. It was very important. Very. 

Alternatively, "The Ministry of Not Screwing Things Up" may well have its origins in the nefarious elsewhere. Asia. This is perhaps the greatest reason why presently we have always been at war with [[Eastasia|An Apology - from Strictures United]]. This theory has been gaining almost unprecedented speed of acceptance. At moment of my fingers' very //tap-tap-tapping// it is in fact nearing light speed. [This bodes well for Strictures United, which could go without saying but has not.] Very soon indeed it will be in the ancient past. 

In the aforementioned Eastasian theory the ministry finds its origins not from a law prohibiting //futuit intuenti super regem// but rather from the Eastasian language, namely the phrase //il-eul mangchiji anhneun sayeog//, literally, "the ministry that does not ruin work," and "the employment where was not the mess." For obvious reasons, this proverb has been misinterpreted as one of the Strictures. Recent evidence, however, has led most scholars on and off the matter to agree with absolute //dissensio// that it is not //only// a Stricture but is also a reference to [[Vin, Vice President Carnold]], [[Larry|Larry's Conquest]], and [[Susanna Summers|FaceSpace: New Notifications]] -- the very vice president of Strictures United itself! All of this has becoming very tiredly. The increasing activity of [[The Wanderway]], the all but epidemic of [[SRMD|Science-Related Memetic Disorder]], the arrival/arising of the strangeness of the Orders, not to mention the almighty ambiguity of the origin of the Strictures, it leaves one all but yawning for the end. 

Given the subject of the article, the Strictures must be addressed through more than mere happenstance. The Strictures, sincere evidence suggests, are not human. This is news. Further, whatever animates them is, most likely, not human. It may well be that the strictures animate--or in the case of the Ministry of Not Screwing Things Up (number unknown)-- //de//animate humans, at least in the sense of restricting reproduction. 

Further, and finally, given all of these recent developments, we must send an expedition to find out [[the king's altitude|The King's Altitude]]. Reproduction is dropping nearly as fast as the aforementioned theory is gaining traction. Further, and truly lastly (whether or not the Vin-Larry-Summer is responsible (whether or not it deals in the least with Vin's recent/eternal handicap or chin-scratchings), we must find [[existence]] and ask it that simplest but most necessary of questions: Why?
