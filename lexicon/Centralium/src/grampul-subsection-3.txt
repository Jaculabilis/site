# Title: Grampul Subsection 3

Grampul Sebsection 3, AKA the Central Order, AKA the rusting pile of impromptu gravestones and dead doomsday devices that I had the misfortune to call home.  After two years they've cleared out the corpses—almost—but the stench still lingers like a house party guest who won't take a hint.  It rains every day but somehow the gutters are still full of trash.  And aside from the occasional unlucky tourist, there isn't a man, woman, or child here who hasn't seen nine out of ten of their loved ones perish to [[fire|Typhus Stormbreaker]], lighting, flying robot sharks, [[virtual soldiers|Larry's Conquest]], sudden loss of [[existence]], reverse lightning, [[dediscombobulation|The King's Altitude]], [[rocket-propelled encyclopedia volumes|Missing Files]], mysterious lightning-like energies which were not actually lightning, [[incarnated metaphysical principles|Ontological Abstractions and How to Beat Them to Death]], [[disruption of physical coherence|The Unwritten Stricture]], [[stab wounds|The Piercing Stricture]], [[interruption of causality|Happe]], and/or [[liquid lightning|water-Free Water]]—while simultaneously inflicting one or more of these perils on society themselves.  The trauma sticks to you like napalm.

We had enough problems of our own.  We had a [[corrupt mayor|Acting Mayor "Shades" Parson]] who was eyeing [[Strictures United]]'s [[broken stricture containment facility|Seirapolis]] in case it caused more problems he couldn't just bribe away.  We had a vice president who was [[in deep|FaceSpace: New Notifications]] with SU's local [[fortress laboratory|D.E.A.T.H.S.T.A.R.]] while they [[gathered more talent|Harvey Gardell]] so they could [[enslave us all with a new stricture|An Apology - from Strictures United]].  We had a shared border with [[Hell itself|The Order which is Definitely Not Central]] that it later turned out was only maintained by the efforts of a [[lone bartender|Earthson's Bar and Grill]].  //No one seemed to remember that we should have had a president.//

Whatever the historians say, we had enough to worry about, so it's not surprising we didn't see [[what|Necesscitas Cruciātī Novī]] [[was|The Piercing Stricture]] [[coming|Grand Executor Jargan]] [[for us|The Calamitous Stricture]].  And I certainly didn't intend to end up in the middle of it when everything went "totally nuts-o", as our current president [[wrote|Journal Entry]] at the time.  I'd only been doing my job: I'd overheard that Ursinquisitor [[asking|Greetings to the High Chamberlain]] [[the good Sister|Letter on the Great Corruption]] about the [[Great LaMiLi|The Latitant Macrophobic Limaciform Stricture]], realized there was a lead there, and, [[God help me|Religion (disambiguation)]], [[followed the money|Strictures United Quarterly Financial Update]].
