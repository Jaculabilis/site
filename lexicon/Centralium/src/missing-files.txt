Heyy!

So, like, I have been going through my new desk here as [[Vice President of Strictures United|The Ministry of Not Screwing Things Up]] and I like, can not figure out where in the the world all these missing files are at! I have looked in like all the drawers and cupboards, looked high and low, and I've like even reached out to the Administrative Department and sent an additional inquiry to [[Human Resources|Satan]] but he totally hasn't responded yet either. WTH! I have absolutely nothing on what happened to the old employees or Volumes 13, 15, 16, 21, and 22 of the [[The Laws of the Strictures]] books! I cannot figure out what I am doing here - can someone like pretty please please please help me?! 

On another note, it seems that due to ongoing [[reticular transcendence]] there will be a temporary closure of [[Earthson's Bar and Grill]] which is a little dissapointing because after days like this - I like totally could use a drink with the girls!
