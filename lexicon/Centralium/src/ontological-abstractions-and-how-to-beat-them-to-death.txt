Ontological Abstractions and How to Beat Them to Death was Knorff's second great treatise on the nature of reality, gods, hell, and poetry.  At just over six thousand pages in length, it is noted as the single longest book of poetry ever written (although the total text of the poetry amounts to approximately one and a half pages).  

The poems, extremely short stories, and songs of Ontological Abstractions and How to Beat Them to Death are loosely connected, with each representing Knorff's celebration of her philosophy of metaphor, abstraction, and life.  Influenced by the works of Vandal Von Doomsday, [[Typhus Stormbreaker]], and [[St. Aquila of the Pen|The King's Altitude]],  Knorff's poetry praises the merging of the real with the unreal and then beating it to death.  However, much like Aquila, Knorff does not diminish the role of the mind or the spirit.  

Among the works in the collection are "Pour [[Something Poisonous|Water-Free Water]] On Their Eyes", "If They Look Dead Kick Them In The Ribs Again", and "Litany for the Binding of Loki" (the last is heavily cross-referenced with Section 225B, pages 4986-5012 containing instructions for capturing and slaying the [[CHILD OF URMOTHER|DEAR OLD LOKI, “CHILD” OF URMOTHER]] for the purposes of [[making|The Laws of the Strictures]] a [[world-cleansing weapon|Wise Bob, the Sequitor who Exploded Most Direly]].  Indeed reading the two side by side give the best possible experience and provide context for the rhymes and syllables).  

Since the influx of various scholars of variable note, the demand for Ontological Abstractions and How to Beat Them to Death has skyrocketed in the [[Central Order|Grampul Subsection 3]].  This has implications on the literacy and literature-appreciation effects of [[rampaging ontological abstractions|The Laws of the Strictures]] on the general public.  Most Noted Scholar Eternal Eurythian Himself has purchased/consumed a copy.  As the Most Noted is fundamentally himself a god, this may be considered the absolute height of popularity for Knorff's beloved book of poems.

**Notes**

~

The death of Loki has orphaned the Strictures themselves, resulting the consumption and absorption of most of them by the Most Noted Scholar E. Eurythian.  The impact this may have on book sales is unpredictable at the present moment.
