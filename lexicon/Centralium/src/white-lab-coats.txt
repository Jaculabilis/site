# Title: White Lab Coats

They say that in some parts of the Antipode Order, the sidewalks get hot enough to fry an egg on.  Brings a new meaning to "sunny side up."  Waste of an egg, if you ask me, but no one ever asks me.  

People also say that you can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs.  As I walked through the gloomy drizzle, I caught a glimpse of the broken sphere that used to be the [[Seirapolis]].  One hell of a broken egg, that one.  They hadn't finished rebuilding the destruction from when the Strictures ran loose after the [[energy reactors went down|Vin, Vice President Carnold]].  I shuddered to think what kind of omelet was getting cooked up from that.

Lighting a cigarette, I decided to check up on a contact of mine who might know more about what SU was planning.  He was a bit of a reticent fellow, refusing to go by anything other than "Q".  From what I knew of the man(?), it probably wasn't even his real initial. But he was an absolute tech whiz, and if anyone had deeper access to SU's systems, it'd be him.

The apartment complex was dilapidated and full of unsavory characters.  I guess I look like a bit of an unsavory character myself, because none of them gave me any trouble beyond intimidating glares. I found my way to a darkened hallway.  The tripwires didn't pose much of a problem, unless you count the one that set my trenchcoat on fire.

With a light knock on his door, I flung myself backward so the flamethrower behind the door wouldn't flash-broil me.

"Who are you?  How did you find this location?" snapped a distorted voice through a speaker.

"It's Murph, and you gave me directions last time you had an anonymous tip that couldn't be spoken over the phone."  Ten bucks said this wasn't his real location, either, but if I brought that up he might activate the proximity mines.

"Hah!  They've got all of the phones, I tell you!  Might as well mail them a transcript of your day!" 

"I'm wondering what else they've got," I said.  "Can you tell me anything about Carnelian's plans for Central?"

"It's all about the [[Thirteenth|An Apology - from Strictures United]], I tell you," said the voice.  "//All// of Carnelian's memos //sum to a multiple of thirteen if you convert them to binary and add the ones together//!"

"Do you know what they're going to use the Thirteenth for?"

"Nothing yet.  They've got to bring it to life first," said the voice.  "I've hacked the security cameras in their [[logomantic|logomancy]] research wing.  Do you know what I [[saw|Zetta Computing]]?"

"Not a clue."

"Perfect.  Stay the hell out of my head."  The voice paused for a moment, then continued.  "Anyways, Mr. Reynolds, I saw //white lab coats//."

I whistled.  You only see white lab coats on people who have gone off the deep end — for example, I had no doubt my friend Q here was wearing one.  That meant Strictures United had to be employing actual mad scientists.  Mighty suspicious for an organization dedicated to preventing that.

"The implications are obvious," the voice continued.

"Of course," I lied.  "Well, I'm off to investigate some mad logomancers.  You know where to find me."

"Goodbye.  Mind the privacy hammer on your way out."

"What privacy—"
