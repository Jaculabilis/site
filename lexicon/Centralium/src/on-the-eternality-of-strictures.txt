# Title: On The Eternality of Strictures

[[Earthson's Bar and Grill]] is the only place of any safety left as [[Strictures United]] has raided my [[apartment|White Lab Coats]] knowing that I knew too much and therefore attempting to take me out of the picture but the resistance movement let me know in a final communique provided by the logo on a SUmmer Vacation Planning pamphlet* warning me of an oncoming SUrprise raid on my apartment. I feel oh so very sorry for whoever was first through the door and highly doubt they remember what year it is.^ I sit in the grill with closed doors open to all with a recent covering of tin foil to keep the thrice damned [[logomancers|logomancy]] [[employed by SU|White Lab Coats]]. They cannot get us here so long as Earthson remains and the man remains vigilant against all forces of man and bear and infernal being.

After covering the bar with tin foil and unplugging all computer terminals and phone outlets to ensure we would not be spied upon I had some time to pass and I looked at the various books and tomes stored in the rooms of the bar and after passing over archived copies of [[SU Quarterly Reports|Strictures United Quarterly Financial Update]] and Liber Ivonis and a compendium of non-euclidean beer brewing techniques and a very strange set of scholarly reports circling around some apocalypse in another dimension and time I picked up a strange volume //On the Eternality of the Strictures// which was so completely and utterly boring that it fascinated and entertained me to no end.

The [[first page|Grand Executor Jargan]] contained some small amount of information on the Strictures including the process by which one may bind the [[abstract to the concrete|Strictures United Quarterly Financial Update]]. However after the first page` it launches into a manifesto of causal-breaking party crashing parties and I will say [[Jargan|Grand Executor Jargan]] certainly knows how to throw a party and as the Grand Executor of such he has not only launched many parties but has been known to //literally// crash parties which has resulted in numerous floating stations filled with party-goers and business executives having a very untimely end and he even managed to sneak out of and therefore into a [[top secret strictures meeting|D.E.A.T.H.S.T.A.R.]]. From reading through his accomplishments and MO and general goal it is obvious and clear and beyond a doubt that he was involved in the collapse of the [[Breaching Stricture|The Breaching Stricture]] and [[Seirapolis]] because after all what could ever possibly be a greater crash than this and what [[sort of parties could he throw|Grand Executor Jargan]] in the chaos that ensued?

Some tin foil just got torn by that odd PI who has a bump on his head so I must repair the damage before it's too late.

`The pages are approximately three feet by two feet, so one page does contain quite a bit of information.
