# Title: Happe

The Happe, a race of diminutive elephant-faced humanoids, were first documented — or first arrived, depending on the source text — along the western coast of the former USSA. Following the first encounters, a number of agnostic mission attempts were made in order to convert the Happe from their apocalyptic, and at times violent, belief in the coming of [[The Happenstancening]], a futuric event of liberation from causality and the possibility of further prophecies and predictions. The sworn enemy of the Happe, is, they say, the “Sequitor.”

The language of the Happe involves clickings of the tongue and wavings of the trunk, and no true speaking, they believe, can take place without at least two speakers, speaking simultaneously, and one [[Affirmator]], who declares, seemingly at random, which speaker is correct with a shouts of “Almond!” and “Zemben!” these words seem to have identical meanings but bring about seemingly unrelated and inconsequential results.
