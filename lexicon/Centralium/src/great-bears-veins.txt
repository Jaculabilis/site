# Title: Great Bear's Veins

There's an old legend whispered among the Ursinquisitors, of some mythological sonnuvabitch they call the Great Bear. There's some tall tales about its great deeds, stoic character, noble sacrifice, et cetera. It's all very dry to anybody who isn't in the Inquisition itself. I copied a few of them in my day, but I must confess I didn't pay any attention to the contents. [[Leylines of power?|Letter on the Great Corruption]] Meh. The only thing it seems to give the bears is something to cry out to when I've got them in a chokehold. Look, I ain't no saint. When I was assigned by the Abbess as the cultural liaison to the Ursinquisitus, I skipped all the assigned reading. The bears didn't take it very well, but my fists were liaison enough for that. So, I don't have a lot to say about the Great Bear or his veins.

It's probably all a moot point by now: the Orders are all but kaput, their already tenuous stability utterly broken by the [[Fifth Crusade|Necesscitas Cruciātī Novī]]. The Strictures aren't going to do anybody any more good in the state they're in now, [[not that there are many people even //left//|Journal Entry]] to do good to. I didn't check, but I assume the Scriptorium exploded, or imploded, or something of the sort. If the **Great Bear's Veins** had any significance, there's nothing left for them to signify. They're of the past, now.

I am, if nothing else, an educator, and I'll be damned if I won't turn this into a hard-earned lesson for //someone//. But hey, around these parts, causality is fickle. I don't much care who gets taught or what connection the lesson has to recent events. So, I'm going to [[hell|The Order which is Definitely Not Central]], and I'm going to teach [[Satan]] a lesson about what happens when you piss off an Aquiline &mdash; or are involved in something that pisses off an Aquline, or are near a pissed-off Aquiline, etc.
