Wake up sheeple! Another message encoded onto the back of a SUreal box from the 
underground resistance and I found if you take its puzzle and solve it incorrectly you are able to derive the exact [[financial records of Strictures United|
Strictures United Quarterly Financial Update]] leaving one with the question the burning question that sears the back of your mind until it is raw with processing and that question is //how// exactly did Strictures United manage to make precisely no money at the time where they have completely dominated all known markets?

The answer is so simple only the most blind could not realize it and that is that clearly and obviously Strictures United is investing [[ungodly|religion (disambiguation)]] sums of capital into their server farms to finish their nefarious plot to mine all of us which implies therefore that their [[researchers|Science-Related Memetic Disorder]] that they have caged away must have made a breakthrough and gone beyond their Yotta Computing paradigm (which incidentally was what caused this whole catastrophe in the first place*) to their final computer stage and that means that soon the machines will be INSIDE our heads which is why I urge everyone to stop using their names online because that is exactly precisely how they get you!

*: See the fact that a ctrl-F on [[Stricture's so-called "apology"|An Apology - from Strictures United]] for 'Y' yields 43 results which is the same amount of years they claim to have taken place since the disaster! This is no coincidence and perhaps you may respond that five of those Ys are part of the page itself and not part of the article. Well how many letters are in 'Yotta' may I ask!
