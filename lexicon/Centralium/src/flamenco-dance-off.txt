# Title: Flamenco Dance-Off

After a long sequence of concrete-shattering blows, the Sister and the Ursinquisitor tottered off to the [[local bar|Earthson's Bar and Grill]] with their arms around each other's shoulders.  Me, I didn't have a handy shoulder nearby, so I had to drag myself up the hard way.

I won't bore you with the details on [[logomancy]], mostly because every time I figured it out, it slipped out of my head like how this metaphor is getting away from me right now.  The one thing I retained was that most logomantic work is done through **Flamenco dancing**.  One of the problems in early logomancy was that people's internal monologue kept getting caught up in the 
rituals and screwing everything up.  Back then logomancers used to use meditation and contemplation to clear their minds, but nowadays the old methods are considered too inefficient.  Instead, they set up a translator that generates logomantic output from muscle movements.  Sounds great in theory, but it turns out they could only get it to work by dancing at it, and flamenco is the only dance style that works reliably.

[[SU|Strictures United]] is in a tight spot right now because their best dancer, [[Harvey Gardell]], has arthritis and can't keep pulling the same workload he used to.  But why would they be pulling in mad scientists to support him?  Mad scientists dance like a drunken six-year-old on an exercise ball, and don't ask me how I know what that looks like.  The notion's absurd.

I didn't even want to consider the alternative, but it was grinning at me out of the corner of my eye like a thirteen-car pileup that started with a school bus and a van full of clowns.  It was too horrible not to stare.

Mad scientists are terrible dancers, yes, but they excel at messing with [[forces|The Happenstancening]] [[beyond|Existence]] [[their|Necesscitas Cruciātī Novī]] [[control|Religion (disambiguation)]].  That could only mean one thing:

Strictures United was trying to summon the [[best dancer of all|DEAR OLD LOKI, “CHILD” OF URMOTHER]].
