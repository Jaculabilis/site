# Title: The Laws of the Strictures

I did my best to stay out of sight as I made my way back into the city.  My last encounter with an Ursinquistor had left me with a limp, and from the way these ones were setting fire to everything around them, it seemed prudent to give them a wide berth.  I saw a squad of four bears tear through a group of civilians, and I do mean that literally.  They were shouting the [[Piercing Stricture|The Piercing Stricture]] in eerie unison, scything their claws through flesh and bone like a particularly splattery putty.

With every syllable, the doilies on their armor glowed, and I felt a dark, familiar tug on my bones. I hadn't felt that tug in two years.  Last time I'd felt it, I'd...

Look.  No one likes to talk about what they did during the [[Happenstancening|The Happenstancening]], okay?  It's considered something to avoid at all costs in polite company.  But for the sake of explaining the whole story, I'll spill the beans.  In my addled state, I'd reasoned that since logomancy was such a powerful force, I could make an unbeatable weapon by firing words at people.  So I built a weapon that would teleport random [[encyclopedia|Missing Files]] [[volumes|Journal Entry]] into the barrel, then fire them at immense speeds.  I say all this to explain why I happened to have Volume 22 of **The Laws of the Strictures** among my possessions.  

But before I could connect those dots, a mob of identical people in white robes charged the bears with a battle cry that used no vowels I've ever heard before or since.  Yep, definitely Eurythians.  The maniacal cultists fought the bears with anything from strange weapons cracking with unknown energies to their bare, if you'll pardon the pun, hands.  Limbs flew everywhere—more than you'd expect, given the number of combatants—and then I lost sight of the battle due to a literal mist of blood.  Then it ended, two Ursinquisitor survivors stepping into the [[Wanderway|The Wanderway]] while a blood-drenched Eurythian raised his hands and cried "SPLEEEEEEEEENS!"

On closer examination, he had one clutched in each fist.

One of them galloped toward me, carrying an unconscious child under his remaining arm.  Probably a freshly-minted orphan from the bears' massacre.  "Good evening," he said, as if he were inviting me into his study and not not soaked in his own blood from a brutal melee.  In either case, there's only one way to greet a Eurythian.

"My mother's fine and in good health," I said, nodding cordially.  "How goes the war?"

"The Most Noted Scholar has suggested that we pull out of the Central Order," said the Eurythian.  "We're just stopping for snacks on the way out."  He took a bite out of the orphan's ear.

I frowned.  "That's not good.  What about those of us left behind?"

"Noted scholar Emile Eurythian said he saw a bunch of survivors hiding from the bears in a bar," said the Eurythian.  "You could try your luck."

There could only be one bar he was talking about.  There might yet be hope.

I dashed toward my apartment, which contained Volume 22 of The Laws of the Strictures.  It was the final volume, as it so happened, and contained a secret of utmost importance: the knowledge of how to counter the greatest darkness of this world.  That which the Inquisition calls the [[Great Weapon|Unnamed City]] and what Strictures United calls the [[Terminal Void| Strictures United Quarterly Financial Update]]: [[Loki| DEAR OLD LOKI, “CHILD” OF URMOTHER]] himself.

I headed for the [[bar|Earthson's Bar and Grill]], bursting through the door and waving the book over my head.  "I've got the answer!" I shouted, before noticing I'd just torn a hole in a layer of tinfoil that covered the inside of the bar.

"//They found me!//" shouted a familiar voice behind me, and as I turned I saw Q rushing at me, and where had he found a hammer that big //oh shit wait no no no//—
