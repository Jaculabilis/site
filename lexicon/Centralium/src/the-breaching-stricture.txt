# Title: The Breaching Stricture

Notice, notice, notice here my poor petty pretties that the Strictures have order; therefore they uphold the Order.  Order of what description?  It doesn't matter.  Central, acentral, spurious, inner or outer.  Take your pick.  

The Orders appear to your eyes, as they once did mine, as land floating through an infinite [[sky|The Wanderway]].  One, a deathscape.  Yet another, an [[endless city|Necesscitas Cruciātī Novī]]; a third, an endless rolling country, idyllic from afar, but made entirely of worms, rot, and [[lies|Water-Free Water]].  

These are accidents, not //essence//.  We live as bacteria upon the back of a dust speck to the world which once was.  The Orders are bastions against chaos, pieces of that world preserved through use of the Strictures against the timeless march of [[entropy|Wrathrunes]].  Perhaps the World That Was underwent some failure of existence.  Perhaps it did not.  But now we live in a pale shadow of former glory.  

What I have learned has worried me.  The Breaching Stricture works against the integrity of a thought, mind, concept... anything that can be thought of as having coherent structure.  Opening holes within it... For it to [[fall|The Twelve Strictures for Self Assured Safety]] is both self-referential and troubling.  What is next? The [[Binding Stricture|The Binding Stricture]] should bind// itself//?  

The Breaching Stricture also seems to have special power and association with a specific type of pants that stop at or around the knees.  I'm not really sure why this is.  

My battle with the [[Piercing Stricture|The Piercing Stricture]] has left me wounded and my mind and memory with a few gaping holes, but though I had to [[consume most of the population of the Central Order to do it|Necesscitas Cruciātī Novī]]. I have emerged intact, though not unscathed.  Damn [[bears|The Bear Inquisition]].  

There is something or someone within the Order, in the institution known as Strictures United which I cannot for all my power touch.  It is vast and powerful, but a created thing.  I sense the strictures upon it but it is not of them.  There is a [[woman|FaceSpace: New Notifications]] [[who|Journal Entry]] [[seems|An Apology - from Strictures United]] a locus of this power.  Who - what, indeed - //is// she? 

Another note on this person who seems to all the unknowing as a mere intern/vice president/whatever: 

The odd numbered strictures refer to aspects of reality (or unreality). Piercing, breaching, leeching... have you not noticed, dear ones, that all the //even numbered Strictures imply destruction//?  **[[What|Satan]] is it that they were meant to destroy?**

Think on this next time you speak with the Summers girl.
