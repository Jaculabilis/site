People of the Outer Orders,


Our top priority - above everything else, including [[profits|Strictures United Quarterly Financial Update]] - is your safety. We at Strictures United can afford to lose money - even a lot of money - what we cannot afford to lose is our reputation, and we know we can count on you to uphold that.

What happened with the Central Order was unfortunate, for them. We here at Strictures United work hard to secure your safety and apologize for any restlessness this happenstancing has caused, is simply misguided. We can assure you it wont happen again, given you follow our [[Twelve Step Program for Self Assured Safety|The Twelve Strictures for Self Assured Safety]]. These **Twelve Strictures** have been developed by a carefully selected team of specialists with one goal: Your Safety.

As for the criticism circulating the **First Seven Strictures**, we kindly remind you to refer to **//ALL**// Strictures in order to truly reap all benefits allowed to you. It is with this that we would like to add the **Thirteenth Stricture**.

**Stricture 13**

Strictures United was not to blame, it was the people's fault. All apologies by Strictures United are a generous blessing to the people , and therefore completely unnecessary. The Central Order was also completely unnecessary. The Outer Orders are much better. The people want to be in the Outer Orders. The Outer Orders are safe. We have always been at war with Eastasia.
