I always knew the infernal nature of [[Strictures United]] but only now do I see the true depths of absolute evil and understand how horribly wrong things have become as I [[opened the door|Earthson's Bar and Grill]] [["ORD. DEF. NOT C."|The Order which is Definitely Not Central]] and saw the Son of Perdition arrayed in dark glory in his dim domain of the infernal [[HR department|Missing Files]] of SU. The very [[water fountains|Water-Free Water]] bubbled with an unnatural heat as the flames which never die seared my mind in a way that would have broken me had I not first thought to cover myself in protective gear of tin foil and a [[wrathrune|Wrathrunes]] I found squawking next to a keg of hyperreal porter. The ancient serpent raised his claw as he took a phone call and explained that [[wages|Strictures United Quarterly Financial Update]] would not be increasing as the end of the world was upon us and doing so with poise and grace and calming the disgruntled employee with the assurances that any further complaints would result in eternal damnation.

The Father of Lies spoke horrid truths of the Happenstancening. He told of strictures collapsing and [[orders|The Order which is Definitely Not Central]] coming together and falling apart and as he did my mind reeled and split into fractal non Euclidean planes as I saw the [[The Bear Inquisition]] bringing death and destruction upon all of Central Order and I saw the [[void and the strictures|Void and Stricture: Reality as the Dance of Presence and Absence]] dancing throughout all Existence and as he spoke such hideous truths out of his mouth that is a grave I saw [[Strictures United]] form yet again and the Strictures rise in a yet inevitable collapse as causality split apart and the Strictures failed because of the Happenstancening and the Happenstancening was caused by the collapse of the Strictures.

I fled and as I fled I looked to the side and saw the security cameras of the [[logomantic|logomancy]] research wing and saw those horrible [[White Lab Coats]] working on the [[thirteenth stricture|An Apology - from Strictures United]] that had already been created. [[Strictures United]] was the cause but it was also the effect my mind's fragments computed as I fled from the hideous truths spouted by the Accuser back into the bar that was and was not a bar and collapsed inside a room marked **REDACTED**. When I woke up I heard a light knock at the door and a burst of a flamethrower that sounded oddly familiar.

"Who are you? How did you find this location?" my voice sounded strange to my ears and the visitor said, "It's Murph, and you gave me directions last time you had an anonymous tip that couldn't be spoken over the phone," and little did he know that this was not my actual location but the bar that was not a bar. I must tell him of what I saw that cannot be described and of the white lab coats and the logomancy and the coming of the end that is the beginning I must tell them all that endings are only beginnings and boundaries are only conventions as the world spins ever in a cycle that we may one day possibly escape. Possibly.
