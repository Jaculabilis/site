# Title: The Order which is Definitely Not Central

Our world is filled with chaotic Orders.  This is one of them.  

The OWIDNC is the territory theoretically located between the Lateral Order and the Antipode Order, but somewhere below the Uncentral Order.  Strictures United insists that the OWIDNC is upheld by four stricture-like entities, and the OWIDNC insists that it has seen no such articles.  This opens the possibility of hidden strictures, but such things are forbidden to speculate upon ever since the [[Great Infectioning|Science-Related Memetic Disorder]].  

Indeed, the existence of the OWIDNC is speculatory at this point, due to the Happenstancening's uncoupling effect of nation-states along very precise geographical boundaries.  As the OWIDNC was disputed territory between the Spurious and Improvised Orders, it is entirely probable that the entire territory crumbled to dust from the strain.  

Statements from the Green House (the governmental entity of the OWIDNC) have maintained that the OWIDNC does indeed still exist, and that its trade embargoes against the Central Order remain in effect.  Spokesman [[Cathyr Van Sacrilege]] of the Order which is Definitely Not Central's Ministry of Happiness prepared this written statement: 

//we exist u fagrats.  u cant ignore us, we c u flying ur aetherships by wit ur fingers in ur ears yelling lalalalala we cant see u.  its hurtful cmon bru.  also heil [[Satan]]//

Eyewitness accounts note that the OWIDNC may or may not exist, as a fuzzy ghostlike blur out the corners of eyes, possibly due to refusal to look directly at the Order itself.  Questions as to whether passers by do indeed have their fingers in their ears yelling 'lalalalala' are unfounded, as questioners tend to stick their fingers in their ears and yell "lalalalala".  It is unknown whether these are memetic effects due to the Happenstancening, or whether another, simpler explanation is at play, like racism.  

Stay tuned for more reports as events warrant.
