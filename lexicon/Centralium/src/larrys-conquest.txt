# Title: Larry's Conquest

Larry's Conquest began prior to the Happenstancening, which may account for ongoing [[reticular transcendence]] of conquestorial elements.  Little is known of Larry Wernhauser, for the Happenstancening fundamentally altered the molecular integrity of all extant records.  That which we know of his early life we glean from reticular echoes.  One such echo (named by famed academic Eudice Eurythian as 'The Atomic Wedgie') can be observed as slowed image by the ruins of the Mitral Iris, wherein one of Larry's famed rivals Big Todd can be seen to this day contributing to the later volatility of the conquest.  

The most reliable records for the latter half of the Conquest are oral, as memetic effects are among the mildest results of the Happenstancening.  It is known that at one time Larry's empire spanned the known world both east-to-west and top-to-bottom (though not north-to-south).  Larry famously restricted airspace privileges to those with a BMI above 26. 

One notable song, cross referenced with various oral traditions, holds that Larry's army stopped at the gates of [[Unnamed City]], whereupon the local ruler struck a deal; the rulership of the city would be decided in a virtual battleground, mediated by a neutral "dungeon master".  Famously, Larry won the fight using virtual commander Typhus Stormbreaker by exploiting the simplifying logic that governs the virtual.  He allegedly forced 377 (some records say 369) virtual characters to prepare to pass a stone from the character behind to the character in front, which resolved at instantaneous speed, allowing the stone to reach a speed of approximately 200 mph.  Sixty lines of peasants easily decimated the opposing army, filled with veteran cavalry and footmen.
