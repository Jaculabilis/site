Hey all,

I like noticed the archives didn't have any details on Seirapolis so I like totally found some random things in my office drawers that dont make any sense to be here so I just wanted to forward that back to you! Thanks girl!!

**Seirapolis:**

**A once cutting edge nuclear energy reactor, now a shattered dream of cut edges. Some debates remain on the cause of the meltdown of Seirapolis, but the collapse of [[the breaching stricture|The Breaching Stricture]] is undoubtedly linked to its last few hours.**

**Once, a thriving workplace of nuclear energy, it powered the entire Central Order. Now, nearly all of it's affected employees have been relocated in hopes of recovery from the side effects of the meltdown and are in a [[top notch facility dedicated to their wellness|Unnamed City]]. Those few that remained unaffected, invested in a [[local public house|Earthson's Bar and Grill]] and can often be found now lingering in the back corners of the establishment during open hours.**

If anyone else notices they like, have something on this incomplete file, let me know because I'm just trying to make sense of all the drama happening here!

Oh and like also as a reminder, stay away from Seirapolis because its totally still toxic and like, you don't wanna be there. Thanks, all!
