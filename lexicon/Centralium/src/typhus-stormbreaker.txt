# Title: Typhus Stormbreaker

While he is best known among the Orders for his role as virtual commander in [[Larry's Conquest]], **Typhus Stormbreaker** continued to accomplish great things with his life, especially after it properly began.

Upon returning to his people, the Sequitor, Typhus Stormbreaker introduced the new technology taught (perhaps inadvertently) by Larry and was elevated to real commander with no small amount of pomp, virtual and figurative explosions, and, for the first time in their histories, real explosions. The Sequitor, a race of most peculiar ability and limits, a rare mingling of virtual, fleshy, and figurative blood, had not at this point in time invented any use for gunpowder. They had invented gunpowder, of course, but its possible uses had evaded the minds of their virtual-fleshy-figurative blood. It was to them a grand mystery. They treasured it like they treasured fire, though they kept them in separate capitals. The only known reason for this is their oral tradition. According to Fion’s account of Mion’s account of Renot’s account of Golb’s account of Temnor’s account of Salif’s account of [[Bob|Wise Bob, the Sequitor who Exploded Most Direly]]’s dying words, “The servants of Fire were angry. I tickled them with the black sand and I exploded most direly. Do not tickle the Fire.” After these words he died, according to Jimmy, Fion’s brother. Bob was once very respected among the Sequitor. His name meant, in their speech, more or less, “going up and down with the timing of things.” This was a good name. It is now a bad name.

While the Sequitor have yet to discover a use for gunpowder beyond hoarding it, they have since learned to make explosions thanks to Typhus Stormbreaker. Among the Sequitor, even those who have been elevated to real or figurative status have the innate virtual ability of instantaneous resolution. It took Typhus Stormbringer’s victory as virtual commander under Larry to realize the uses of this. (Previously it had happened only accidentally, which is why Sequitor do not run in large numbers.) T

As a result of these innovations, the Sequitor became a mining people. They erected great towers with clever footholds to drive drills, rocks, and other such objects deep into the ground. They found that the gunpowder was less likely to tickle Fire if it was kept safe in large chambers beneath the Orders. These chambers have since been used to host great revelries, parties, and reproductive dances as, being underground as they are, they are as though guaranteed to be beneath [[the King's Altitude]].
