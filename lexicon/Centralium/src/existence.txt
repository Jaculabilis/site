Aha! I knew that the SUper market was yet another front for the underground to release its communiques. The flickering lights above the pale white floors are intentionally flickering of course, and if you look carefully you'll realize that it can be translated via Morse code! Of course doing so results in nothing but the gibberish of a madman but if you instead translate the flickers into binary and run the numbers through a Fourier transform and then divide the result by zero you receive the location of the exact answer to that ultimate question of "WHY???" Clearly **Existence*** is a member of the underground and has a report of that one question the Strictures hide so well that question whose answer I have received indicates that the only answer is found of course as the bottom of a lager which itself is found at [[the fount of answers|Earthson's Bar and Grill]] of the man Earthson^ which is of course one of the last vestiges of goodness and resistance. But to fully unlock the question we require of course both a [[Happe]] and an [[Affirmator]] after all without the two of these specimen we cannot know the answer even if we hear it. And OF COURSE these have been locked away in the [[underground vaults|D.E.A.T.H.S.T.A.R.]] of [[Strictures United]] for their own nefarious purposes. The people must rise up!!


*The -3rd Hidden Stricture.
