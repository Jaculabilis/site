# Title: Water-Free Water

Are you water-free and tired of dealing with the problems that come with it? Well, good news for all you sea-liacs out there, because a crack team of [[genuine, reliable researchers|White Lab Coats]] has created a product that will blow your minds!

Did you know? Of the 23 self-identifying H2Obophobes who responded to the survey, 39% said they were against water for ethical reasons. "A poet writes of a lake of ice in the deepest layer of hell," one surveyor stated, "Mix that with the firey upper half and what do you get? The [[devil's|Satan]] liquid."

It breaks my heart to know that many these people are living with serious conditions, such as dry-mouth syndrome or simply dying of dehydration. But all these problems are about to be solved forever, with the unveiling of our new miracle product, Water-Free Water!

What did you say? Water-Free Water? How is that even possible? By harnessing the power of [[aetheric currents|The Wanderway]], researchers were able to isolate the core essence of not-water-ness and infuse it into this revolutionary new beverage. Our manufacturing process is completely natural; some believe [[primitive species|Happe]] were exploiting it even before the [['Stancening|The Happenstancening]].

So what are you waiting for? If you're experiencing any of the issues I mentioned, or if you just want to get in on the hottest new drink, get some Water-Free Water today!

Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm a little thirsty. I think I'll just grab a bottle of... hey, you're not still recording, are you?
