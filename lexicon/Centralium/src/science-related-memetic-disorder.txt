# Title: Science-Related Memetic Disorder

It's been two years since the Happenstancening, and society's only just 
picked itself off the ground to sort through some of the larger 
pieces, like a kid who got thrown through their tower of blocks by a 
tornado.  There's folks who lost everything in the conflagration. 
And there's folks who'll make it no matter what, like cockroaches and dirty 
politicians.

Me, I'm a cockroach.  Not a literal cockroach, just a sour detective 
dressed in grubby clothes in a grubbier office. But like a cockroach, if 
there's a morsel of food buried nearby, you can bet I'll find it. 
That's why I wasn't too surprised when the [[Mayor|Acting Mayor "Shades" 
Parson]] waltzed through my door one dismal afternoon and told me I was 
gonna investigate the root of the Happenstancening.  The pay was good 
and he was smiling like a virgin on prom night, all nervous excitement, 
so I couldn't turn him down.

Everyone knows what happened.  There's something called 
**Science-Related Memetic Disorder**, and if you catch it you start 
laughing maniacally, don a lab coat, and cobble together doomsday 
machines from household appliances.  Most of us have been infected, but the 
Seven Strictures were designed to suppress SRMD.  Yet, on the night 
of the Happenstancening, every single one of us spontaneously relapsed. 

Everyone knows //what// happened, but it was my job to figure out //why//. 
So I did the obvious thing: I high-tailed it out of there, headed 
straight for [[Earthson's|Earthson's Bar and Grill]], and ordered myself 
a scotch.
