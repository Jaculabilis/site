# Title: Religion (disambiguation)

**Religion** is any inspirational methodology of designated performances and habits, world posturing, textwords, sanctified zones, utilitarianisms, [[strictures|Strictures United]] or managements, that plop humans, sub-humans, otherwise-than-humans, and post-humans to the super-natural, prima-natural, transcendental, and/or reticular. 


**Religion** may also refer to:

//Religion// (journal)

a) an academic journal of the humanitarian, humanistic, and anthropocentric religions. The journal fell into disfavor with the general public with the collapse of generally-accepted-binaries in the early 2000s and subsequently went out of print. 

b) one of many “prop-chines” [propaganda machines, the most famous of which is probably [[SUpper Home Cooking Magazine| Acting Mayor "Shades" Parson]]) published by [[Strictures United]]. Following their acquisition of EGI, SU created the journal in The Month of the Squatting Cow in 2965, much to the chagrin of many ancient historians who called it an act of “temporal appropriation.” Many of the more offended scholars rioted most direly for a few days about it, overturning their own desks but promptly simmered down. According to some interviews, the whole desks thing was a custom of “Gewis Godnem,” or if not a custom an event. It happened, they claim, sometime amid the BC-AD Timeline Confusion. When asked whether or not their desk overturning was itself an act of “temporal appropriation”  the interviewee refused to comment. According to another related interview, this was not a custom, but rather a more singular event. It was, he said—with almost incoherent excitable speed, said the interviewer—“most likely a time traveling man from Former North-South-America with messianic delusions named //Jeus//.” The consensus on table (or in this case desk) overturning is that is has something to do with the BC-AD Timeline Confusion. [Some recent scholars have noted that this may have been a sort of “pre-tremor” of the Happenstancening.]

//Religion// ([[Carnold Vin, Vice President|Vin, Vice President Carnold]] album), postponed due to hand injury.

//Religion// ([[Strictures United]] album), a soothing and slightly unsettling ambient track featuring recordings of daily office life and clips of instrumental music where names and confidential information were censored. Released daily. 

//Religion// ([[The Bear Inquisition]] album), a highly acclaimed yearly release featuring chants, recordings from inquisitorial sessions, and ambient tracks of [[the Wanderway]]. Released quarterly. [**Note:** Listener discretion //extremely// advised.]

//Mythology//, a body or collection of myths. 

//Religion//, a very old word that may or may not be related to the Strictures.

**Religion** is any inspirational methodology of designated performances and habits, world posturing, textwords, sanctified zones, utilitarianisms, [[strictures|Strictures United]] or managements, that plop humans, sub-humans, otherwise-than-humans, and post-humans to the super-natural, prima-natural, transcendental, and/or reticular. 

Different religions may or may not contain various elements ranging from “the divine,” “sacred thing-objects,” “faith,” one or more “supernatural beings,” one or less “non-supernatural beings (up until the late 2000s, read: human),” “some sort up ultimate util-deciding factor or arbiter, “rituals,” “pilgrimages,” “crusades,” feasts, inquisitions, “a man called but not named ‘father,’” dancing, snake handling, “clothes,” after-life, dogma, participation, “observation,” giving of money, eternal promotions and eternal demotions (based on good or bad behavior), there are two things shared by all religions: a) binary thinking (believers v. non believers) and b) an obsession with being The Greatest Believer.

For example, in the former “New World,” there were once religions centered around practicers observing the “players” (their word for “clergy”) send balls into nets, over poles, or across lines drawn on the ground. They would do this is “games” (their word for “crusades,” as far as we can tell). The observers of these religions would watch these in large open-air cathedrals or on illuminated boxes in their homes. They would chant when their group put the ball their more. They would purchase “clothes” to show alliances. At times they would riot in the streets in joy or anger. They would spend much money donating to their group, buying balls, pretending to be clergy, wearing special “clothes,” and so on. There were many denominations of this religion, but the most noted had an egg-shaped ball. It was a dangerous religion at times. People got hurt. Many of the clergy would retire from wounds. Many of the practicers would injure each other from the sheer joy or sorrow of a “game won” or a “game lost.” “Game” was their word for “sermon.” It is a rough translation, but mostly accepted.

There were also religions, older religions, that would wear armor and go after and—intentionally!—kill practicers of other religions. 

Some religions are more simple. Practicers just sit under waterfalls, drink very good tea prepared very slowly, get hit on the head when they think of not practicing their religion, and so on. 

Other religions were more of a protest against more obvious practicers. Some of these would say they believed in [[Satan]], but would more or less do whatever they wanted while also trying not to hurt other people. The stricter “our Big Person is the Right Big Person” religions tended to poo-poo this religion often, because Satan was for them the captain of “the other team.”

Some religions went so far as to ta...
