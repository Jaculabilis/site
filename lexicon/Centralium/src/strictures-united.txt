//Ia!  The worldwound!  The crawling within the deep!//

In 2028 the Aetheric explorer Vandal Von Doomsday, traversing the underside of the Central Order during a once-in-a-millennia quirk of the [[Wanderway|The Wanderway]], wrote of an "upward-facing abyss" in the unmarred Soulstone edifice lining the bottom (terminus-face) of the Central Order, "an inky darkness from which [[a peculiar madness|Science-Related Memetic Disorder]] emanates".  

In 2962 Evil Goods Incorporated launched an expedition to the terminus-face of the Central Order.  The results of this expedition were not made public, and in two years EGI was bought out by the nascent Strictures United. 

Notably, in early 2965 company memos entitled "Containment Breach" have surfaced via corporate espionage agents (they call themselves 'runners').  At around this time, the [[Great Infectioning|Science-Related Memetic Disorder]] occurred.  

SU response to this was swift and effective.  Release of [[The Binding Stricture]] and related Stricture-derived pharmaceuticals suppressed [[SRMD|Science-Related Memetic Disorder]].  Academics have perused its bizarre text, memetic effects, and documented the way in which the letters are readable no matter what script they are in.  As the Stricture became less and less effective in suppressing [[SRMD|Science-Related Memetic Disorder]] SU rose to this challenge by releasing strictures over a period of years ending with the [[The Latitant Macrophobic Limaciform Stricture]] in 2971.  

But what //is// the nature of the Strictures themselves?  The structure of even the [[First|The Binding Stricture]] is mathematically infinite; binding-effects allow infinite syllables to be recited or scribed within moments.  Observe: the echo of an echo, stilled image that takes the form of the terminus-facing worldwound in the exoskeleton of the Central Order.  See what lies within, older than time.  Written into stone crystalized from the dreams of dead gods, laws which are Strictures which are the bones of reality.  These are older things than any petty institutions; they are old as the swirling chaos beyond the beyond.  

Indeed, this is the source of sapience itself!  The Seven, gods in their own right!  But we were foolish, foolish in our desires, selfish desires to bind, to mine, to harvest and extract and sell.  To think that we could have contained them.  


From the shattered pieces left behind by [[They That Wrote the Strictures|DEAR OLD LOKI, “CHILD” OF URMOTHER]] man has in his arrogance distilled and pieced and badly stitched together a new [[twelve (or thirteen, forgive me, for I seem to have misplaced my medication)|An Apology - from Strictures United]] strictures.  Pale imitations of the face of infinity!  

And that brings us to you.  Yes, yes you.  Icarus flies toward the sun, but where Strictures United failed, I shall succeed!  My Icarus comes to swallow the sun!  Once I consume your souls, I will become!  As!  GOD!
