# Title: The Happenstancening

THE HAPPENSTANCENING WAS AN INSIDE JOB!!! What, do you honestly think that [[Strictures United]] with all of their wealth and power couldn't keep the Strictures themselves sustained?? It is a well-documented FACT that the strictures have never been known to fall on their own and yet here we are with two years of destruction and devastation that came from the [[Strictures flickering|Letter on the Great Corruption]]. Who is in charge of the Strictures and tasked with keeping them sustained and has been [[shuffling around employees|Journal Entry]] in an attempt at a cover up in order to shift blame AND has benefited immensely and become the as the single most powerful entity in all the orders?

[[Cathyr Van Sacrilege]] famously said that the hubris of humanity thinking we could [[bind the Strictures|The Binding Stricture]] was not in thinking our technology would hold but rather our fickle and corrupt nature and her taunt has proven too true. And yet we allowed her to lay the foundations for the company regardless of the smirk in her smile and the gleam in her eye and we have been BETRAYED by the company that had so [[evil|The Order which is Definitely Not Central]] an origin.
