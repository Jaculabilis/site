# Title: Grand Executor Jargan

As the foremost nun-scholar of the Scriptorium, it is my responsibility to maintain order on campus. The work of the Scriptorium requires an atmosphere of silent focus in which our scholars may go about their duties of translating, analyzing, and illuminating texts. Threats to this order must be neutralized with extreme prejudice. I therefore spit in disgust as I speak the cursed name of **Shiggles Jargan**, the [[Happe's|Happe]] Grand Executor of Surprise Parties.

Jargan's wretched legacy began in the before-times, which would normally make it nearly inaccessible to prospective imitators. Sadly, however, it remains enshrined in a [[reticular echo by the Mitral Iris|Larry's Conquest]], wherein Jargan is visible giving the infamous "Atomic Wedgie" to Big Todd that catalyzed the latter's psychotic break, indirectly leading to the deaths of thousands. Neither has he slowed down since. In fact, the breakdown in causality has only made it easier to launch surprise parties. Just last week, Jargan's elite CelebraCorps snuck //out// of the Scriptorium's astronomy tower, then reversed the arrow of time and had a party in reverse, incidentally ripping several of our astronomers out of the space-time continuum in the process. My sisters have expressed a desire to get this sort of thing outlawed, so that we have some legal recourse next time, but I would prefer to keep the law out of it. My own way of dealing with these things works better that way, and you just know the [[Mayor's|Acting Mayor "Shades" Parson]] office is too corrupt to do anything about an incident that doesn't threaten their power base.

To my great shame, Jargan's manifesto of unexpected celebration, [[//On The Eternality of Strictures//|On The Eternality of Strictures]], has been preserved within the Scriptorium archives. By giving his compilation of musings, tactics, and techniques such a boring title and opening with a series of long-winded quotes from [[Father Marquette|Greetings to the High Chamberlain]], he seems to have evaded the Scriptorium censors, who subsequently gave the book an //imprimatur// and approved it for the Sacred Archive, despite there being nothing about Strictures beyond the first page. Because books may never be removed from the Archive, but only added, Jargan's vapid expectorations are now permanently enshrined in Scriptorium lore and guaranteed perseverance by our dedicated copyists! The censor responsible for this is going to //wish// they were in [[hell|The Order which is Definitely Not Central]] if I find them.

The title of //Grand Executor of Surprise Parties// is, of course, only one of several Happe ceremonial positions, ranking just above the //Grand Executor of Bagpipe Appreciation// and just below the //Grand Executor of Resistance to Bourgeois Fashion//. The Grand Executors are each responsible for executing the traditional Happe plans for their particular domain. Only Jargan seems to have picked up the double meaning of the title and run with it, aside from that one incident where the Grand Executor of Stand-Up Comedy replaced all of the water in the Spurious Order with [[an impotable liquid|Water-Free Water]].
