# Title: The Latitant Macrophobic Limaciform Stricture


Divinely and aptly named, the **Latitant Macrophobic Limaciform Stricture** (or “the Great LaMaLi,” at it prefers to be called, apparently), Stricture number unknown, is quite possibly among the oldest of the Strictures. Further, it is most likely related (by some ungodly happenstance) to the world-serpent of archaic lore. While this theory is, as all things are since the Happenstancening, as though new, it is, according to many Medievals, in fact quite old. A credible source recently (read: since the Happenstancening) observed [[Loki|DEAR OLD LOKI, “CHILD” OF URMOTHER]] scratching under its ancient chinlike protrusion once when it scampered up from its hole of ageless loneliness and a longing—as only such beings can truly have—for the imminent end of the forthcoming present and reticent past. 

Recently, with the failure of the Seven Strictures, as well as the recent movements of [[Strictures United]], as well as the subtle smooth and altogether ubiquitous and perhaps malicious workings of Sequitor, rumors abound about the reality of the Latitant Macrophobic Limaciform Stricture (read: whether or not it is itself //the only actual reality//). 

In any case, a nearly futuristically recent story has sprung up in the Outer Orders concerning the likeliness that [[Vice President Carnold|Vin, Vice President Carnold]] of Grampul Subsection 3 may or not be Loki, as he too (read: possibly only) was seen scratching the Latitant Macrophobic Limaciform Stricture’s lonely chin.
