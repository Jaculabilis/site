"The evil will lead the blind, for as long as the blind refuse to open their eyes."
-Thelemas Tier, A Simple Bear

From: Thelemas Tier

Greetings Marcellus,

You may be shocked and confused by my manner of address--I assure you it is the least shocking revelation which I will unfold in the course of this, my final missive.

It has come to my attention that there is a deep rot, not only in the core of the Orders, but in the heart of Ursinquisitus, a cancer, a rot that although well hidden and much perfumed was impossible to hide forever. He who has muzzle to smell, let him smell.

The Ursinquisitus is aligned with Corruption and the Void. This is the obvious and necesscary conclusion from the evidence. Consider accounts of the use of the Strictures and the accompanying--and well known to the Ursinquisitus--[[release of corruption.|The Laws of the Strictures]] Our own [[Wrathrunes]] were designed to shunt away such corruption in the event an Ursinquisitor were forced to employ a Stricture in combat. How is it that we tacitly use corruption, even against our enemies? Does not a den divided against itself crumble?

Moreover, I was even willing, with your guidance, to intentionally tear the Aether, unleashing raw corruption on the Orders to wipe them from existence. What purity is this that stains its paws with filth even as it washes its fur? The Six Eternal Strictures that so long we have venerated and to which we have adhered are merely [[corruption incarnate.| Strictures United Quarterly Financial Update]] Everything I have believed is a lie.

There is hope, however, perhaps not for the Ursinquisitus--although possibly if there is redemption for me there is redemption also for my brothers, even you, Brother Marcellus--but certainly for the survival of the Orders and their inhabitants.

The Binding Stricture. Not as concept, not as Eternal Stricture qua corruption incarnate, but in the form of [[a simple woman.| The Breaching Stricture]] I believe that she is the incarnation of the original Stricture from Strictures United. I believe she holds the power to bind the shattered remnants of the Orders, to bind the corporeal and the abstract and heal the Void. 

As I speak, I sit in the middle of a group of refugees in a simple [[public house|Earthson's Bar and Grill]], the pocket of resistance, revolution, perhaps simply rebirth. The woman is here. [[The one who can save us all.|FaceSpace: New Notifications]] She does not yet know what I suspect, although the others do and agree that she is our best hope for the future. 

We are a strange and motley assortment of fellows: A young woman who unknowingly holds great power, a Sister of the Scriptorium who seems more in bearing like an Ursinquisitus than a human woman, let alone a Nun-Scholar--she finds this a high compliment and gleefully reminds me of it whenever she wins an arm wrestling match--a paranoid man who seems to know the inner-workings of almost everything, a tired Private Investigator who--if his stories are to be believed--seems nigh-immortal(or lucky beyond belief), and a Senior Prepositionalist of staggering linguistical might and complexity.

And of course, myself. An ex-Ursinquisitor, a judge, a penitent, a hero or perhaps a monster, a survivor and a destroyer. A simple bear. There will be no further missives. I hereby formally renounce the heresy of the Ursinquisitous, of the False Strictures and their corruption, and any allegiance henceforth to the same. 

If I have any allegiance, it is to Miss Summers, and the hope all we of The Sons of Earth share for a new future.

With great wrath to all corruption, and with greater hope for redemption,

~Thelemas Tier, a simple bear.
