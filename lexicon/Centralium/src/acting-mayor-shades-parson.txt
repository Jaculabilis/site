# Title: Acting Mayor "Shades" Parson

When you see as much as I do you make enemies of all sorts of powerful entities even and including the almost-all-seeing [[Strictures United]]. But even they are blind and have showed their [[hand|FaceSpace: New Notifications]] and not only that but also I've intercepted one of their communiques that they pass in the odd month editions of SUpper Home Cooking Magazines and it would appear they have been foiled in their most recent attempt to [[Stricturize|The Binding Stricture]] our horribly corrupt mayor* into a mayor in their pocket which means that there are still corrupt politicians who are looking to resist and that may mean that there is hope for us to keep the Central Order from falling as [[so many have|The Order which is Definitely Not Central]]. There are not many corrupt politicians left and so it is of vital importance that Mr. Parson stay corrupt and out of the control of Strictures.

~REDACTED 

*Our mayor, who ascended to power through a series of brilliant political maneuvers leading to three [[SU|Strictures United]] candidates being found guilty of sedition during the political scramble of who would temporarily step in for [[The Great LaMaLi|The Latitant Macrophobic Limaciform Stricture]] as he underwent extreme therapy to remove the effects of [[SRMD|Science-Related Memetic Disorder]].
