Hey, so I managed to get my hands on some serious shit, an old recorded transcript of an executive-level meeting at the Headquarters. I could only extract some of the text, but it's enough to know something's going on. Don't believe what they tell you. I'm overwriting this article with what I have so anyone who comes searching will find it.

Side note: anyone know who that other guy could be? Please update this if you do. I have a bad feeling about this.

**Jargan**: You can't seriously believe it will work. You know the strictures are written by--

**Unknown**: The strictures. Are not written. They are discovered. For they are ingrained in the fabric of reality, living things that--

**Jargan**: Enough with this nonsense! We will continue this operation as WE have planned. Your sad devotion to that [[ancient religion|The Fellowship of the Living Word]] has no merit in this discussion.

**Unknown**: I find your lack of faith disturbing. Do you question the power of the eight strictures?

**Jargan**: Of course not, I... but... eight, sir?
