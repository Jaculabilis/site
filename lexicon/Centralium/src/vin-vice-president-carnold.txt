# Title: Vin, Vice President Carnold

Don't just accept whatever common narrative is fed to you by the propaganda of the corporate machine spewing whatever filth they intend to use to control not only you but every man, woman, and child in this entire plane of existence. I have found encoded in the pages of several subtly written books of commentary on Wittgenstein that our own Vice President of [[Grampul Subsection 3]], Carnold Vin is a //pawn// that's right a cog in the machine designed to control the people. I've seen past the lies, what, like the fourth stricture just fell on its own? It was taken down from within and the architect of its demise is none other our beloved Grampul Subsection 3 Vice President.

But it goes deeper than that I know that there was a massive cover up and that there is no way that the collapse of the fourth stricture would cause the failure of the essential [[Seirapolis]] and some fiend other than Vin must have shut down the energy reactors at the same precise moment Vin caused the catastrophic failure of stricture 4 which points to a conspiracy far larger than any of us can comprehend //because// after all who could orchestrate not only the failure of Seirapolis //and// have a Vice President in their pocket //and// only be found by whatever society has to be so deep undercover that they pass messages in dense books on philosophical math? The questions never end but there is one thing that is for certain and that is that we are dealing with a full-blown deep conspiracy. 

Let's see how far this rabbit hole goes.
