<div class="contentblock"><h1>Iurezza (continent)</h1><p>The continent of <b>Iurezza</b> is one of five continents, the others being the <a  href="The_Careless_Continent.html">Careless Continent</a>, <a  href="Xenoarcheological_ruins.html">Vulterland</a>, <a  href="The_Very_Definitely_Independent_States.html">Benri</a>, and Ciphan.  I have always thought it is shaped vaguely like a massive, inverted pear.</p>
<p>Here is a list of things in Iurezza that might be relevant to the Disarrangement Act:</p>
<p>â€¢ The Compass Republic, whose sovereign <a  href="Klaus_Santanna.html">Klaus Santanna</a> runs a global trade network with the help of the <a  href="The_Ulgravian_Diaspora.html">Ulgravian Diaspora</a>.</p>
<p>â€¢ <a  href="High_Exarch_Minor_Seraphi_Ironheart.html">High Exarch Minor Seraphi Ironheart</a>, on whom my esteemed colleague M. Hon. Milton has written an excellent comprehensive report.  I note for the attentive reader that the High Exarch Minor, though usually located on Iurezza, is not necessarily to be found there at all times.</p>
<p>â€¢ Ironheart's country, the Methodocracy of Flandre, whose combination of <a  href="Asynchronous_energy.html">near-limitless energy</a> and rich oil reserves allows them to fuel the Ulgravian zeppelin fleet and protect their trade ships from aggression by <a  href="The_Hegemony_of_Whales.html">the Hegemony of Whales</a>.</p>
<p>â€¢ The historical remains of no less than twelve <a  href="Selestei.html">Selesteine</a> invasions, including those from the <a  href="The_War_of_Durun27s_Ass.html">War of Durun's Ass</a>, the <a  href="The_Roerbach_Incident.html">Roerbach Incident</a>, and the <a  href="Goats_on_Boats_Affair.html">Goats on Boats Affair</a>.</p>
<p>â€¢ <a  href="F09F9487.html"> </a></p>
<p>â€¢ My apologies for the length of the preceding bullet pointâ€”there's just so much to say!</p>
<p>â€¢ The headquarters of the <a  href="The_Venerable_Society_of_Cartographers.html">Venerable Society of Cartographers</a>, whose increasing militarization has lead also to increasing tensions with their host state, Flandre.</p>
<p>â€¢ <i>Several</i> species of bird.</p>
<p>â€¢ Technically, if one goes by the seating conventions of the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns, the <a  href="Placeholden.html">Pseudocracy of Placeholden</a> is located somewhere around here (N.B. no one has ever figured out where their national borders are supposed to go).</p>
<p>â€¢ The Barrowlands, ruled by Sornhandr, the King Eternal.  The <a  href="Barcuvian_antiweather.html">inexplicably perpetual cloudiness</a> of the country makes it difficult to figure out what exactly goes on in there, but distance observation by Flandrean expeditions indicate that the observable parts of the country are just stretches of ancient barrows with no living thing in sight.  I regret to say that my wife has forbidden me to explore it.</p>
<p>â€¢ The city-state of Kingsland, with its terrified inhabitants and the beings that they <a  href="Pantheons_of_Kingsland.html">worship and/or flee from</a>.  I would write more on them here, but the last time I wrote a monograph on Kingsland religion and culture I accidentally summoned some kind of spider demon (not to be confused with their <a  href="Buddy_22Literally_Made_of_Snakes22_Johnson.html">snake demon</a>) and it took forever to get the building repaired.</p>
<p>â€¢ The "dead zone," a no man's land (since the <a  href="The_Night_of_Storms.html">Night of Storms</a>, anyways) historically ravaged by the <a  href="Electric_undead.html">electric undead</a>).</p>
<p>I hope you find this list useful.  Enjoy the deliberations!</p>
