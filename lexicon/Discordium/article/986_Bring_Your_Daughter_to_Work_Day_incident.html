<div class="contentblock"><h1>986 Bring Your Daughter to Work Day incident</h1><p>Ah, the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns.  I can think of no place on earth that is quite like it.  Nowhere else will you find the heights of power so entangled with the lows of maturity.  A place so orderly, yet filled with the pettiest of bickering—and, yes, bloodshed.  One's mind jumps immediately to the noble warriors representing the <a  href="The_Careless_Continent.html">Careless Continent</a>, of course, but we mustn't forget that eventful day in 973 when <a  href="The_Hegemony_of_Whales.html">Hegemon Muoauwu</a> sneezed and accidentally assassinated the Princeps of Saphira, or when <a  href="DAS_Secretary_Ruby_Tomas.html">Madam Secretary</a> beat Queen Hester the Swift of Bolum with a ruler and set off a succession crisis.</p>
<p>Another event sees discussion in the same breath: one that I had the honor of witnessing, the <b>986 Bring Your Daughter to Work Day Incident</b>.  Many scholars express a degree of skepticism about the events that took place here on that day, as there was a great deal of confusion and it was not recorded very well.  However, I have always held a special interest in Flandre, and I happened to be sitting with then eight-year-old <a  href="High_Exarch_Minor_Seraphi_Ironheart.html">Seraphi Ironheart</a> when she set events in motion.</p>
<p>Bring Your Daughter to Work Day was an event put forward, if memory serves, by Deified Hlisst of Kel (who, mind you, is as mortal as the next Sovereign).  The official reasoning for the measure was an opportunity to humanize political opponents and teach the next generation how things are done in these noble chambers.  Little did they realize the next generation contained Miss Ironheart, and that she had a few lessons to teach <i>them!</i></p>
<p>Her first strike was the use of <a  href="Hard_light_projection.html">holographic technology</a>—a present for her seventh birthday, she told me—to create a simulacrum of famed Kushrian champion Balam Al-Hasslain.  Al-Hasslain himself was reportedly quite taken with the projection before she told him that it had been created by scientists of the Veluus Republic (now allied with Kush against their mutual neighbor Gheir, but at the time, a mortal enemy).</p>
<p>Her second move was to spread rumors among the warriors of the Careless Continent that their enemies were hidden among the representatives of the <a  href="The_Very_Definitely_Independent_States.html">Very Definitely Independent States</a>, and that projection technology could be detected by way of a geiger counter.  However, she herself was wearing (harmlessly) radioactive clothing, and had made sure to give every VDIS Sovereign a hug earlier that day.  Thus, the Careless Continent contingent seemingly discovered that <i>all</i> of them were disguised foes, and a massacre began.</p>
<p>The Hegemony would later condemn Flandre, but Flandre maintains that Ironheart was acting independently.  Ironheart has gone on record saying that she was never there, and that the events were actually the handiwork of a <a  href="The_Botherhood.html">Botherhood</a> operative disguised as her, which should have been obvious once everyone found out she was radioactive.</p>
