<div class="contentblock"><h1>The Contagious Republic of Paul Vigotski</h1><p>No one messes with the concept of nationhood like <b>Paul Vigotski</b>.  He's the only person with a seat in the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns who is not actually a Sovereign.  That's because the real Sovereign is the Eubacteriarch, a sentient bacterium that lives in Paul's nasal cavity.  The only academics more fascinated than the biologists are, of course, the memetosociologists, because Paul Vigotski invites the incredibly pressing question "how did this man get recognized as a nation?"</p>
<p>According to interviews with the Eubacteriarch, the Contagious Republic of Paul Vitgotski began with a bacterial infection that evolved sentience at the microbial level.  At the time of the Republic's formation, the Republic numbered around 3 million in population.  Each citizen was given one vote, to be shared by the descendants of that citizen after they underwent asexual reproduction.  Nowadays the Contagious Republic's population numbers around 230 trillion, making it the most populous nation on earth.  This makes votes in the Republic a highly scare commodity, often resulting in unrest that manifests as stomachaches.</p>
<p>The Contagious Republic's appearance on the National Stage came at an opportune moment, right as the <a  href="The_Very_Definitely_Independent_States.html">Very Definitely Independent States</a> began their propaganda campaign for independence.  The bacteria of the Republic worked out a way to hijack Vigotski's sensory and motor neurons, allowing for communication between the miniature Republic and the outside world.  In a speech before the Disputatious Assembly, the Eubacteriarch made its case for statehood, appropriating rhetoric used by the VDIS and their allies to all but ensure the support of that bloc.  Therefore, just as the VDIS were granted some dubious measure of statement, the Contagious Republic also managed to win a seat.</p>
<p>Elevating Paul Vigotski to statehood caused no end of political shenanigans.  Foremost of these was Vigotski's status as a citizen of <a  href="Selestei.html">Selestei</a>, which made the bacteria's colonization of him technically count as an act of war.  Unfortunately for Selestei, while the Contagious Republic compelled Vigotski to sneeze on every door handle he encountered, the Selesteines could only prosecute the war by forcing Vigtoski to take antibiotics.  Vigotski, who was enjoying the media attention, refused.  The war continued in a subdued sort of manner for three years until both nations attended the <a  href="Massively_Parallel_Peace_Conference.html">Massively Parallel Peace Conference</a> and settled on a compromise whereby Vigotski was awarded dual citizenship in both nations.</p>
<p>Today, the Contagious Republic has 32 human citizens, each of which hosts legions of bacterial researchers, artists, and businessgerms.  As such, the Republic's scientific, cultural, and financial output is nearly on par with nations with a much higher human population, and its GDP per capita is the best in the world.</p>

<div class="contentblock"><p>Ah, yes, I remember there was something of a conundrum in the 50's because it seemed like Vigotski himself was getting up there in years.  Everyone was wondering if they'd rename the country after whoever the Eubacteriarch colonized after Vigotski and what would happen to the voting populations that inhabited Vigotski's body.  But it seems like the Republic cracked the secret of cellular regeneration, since Vigotski hasn't aged a day in decades.  Once people figured it out, they were extremely eager to acquire the secret, but the Republic told everyone that they'd need to be colonized for the trick to work.  Interest died out after that.  The older I get, the more I think about taking the offer, but my wife has expressly forbid me from infecting myself just to live forever.  <i>C'est la vie!</i></p>

<div class="contentblock"><p>Honestly, if Selesteines didn't only think with their overdeveloped pectoral muscles, they could have just arrested Vigotski for several billion counts of being an accomplice to illegal immigration.  Then again, if their heads were good for anything besides bashing other people's skulls in, we wouldn't have had the <a  href="The_Roerbach_Incident.html">Roerbach Incident</a>.</p>

<div class="contentblock"><p>The Contagious Republic has probably caused more pain to bureaucrats and paper-pushers than any other country in the Assembly. Their population is several digits wider than any other country's, making it a pain to display in tables. Their ambassadors live inside some of their citizens, making the person of the citizen, properly speaking, the embassy. This means that to mail something to a Vigotskian embassy, one needs the mailing address where the embassy is currently staying. And because they're a nation primarily of microorganisms, instead of singing for their national anthem, they all release a particular mixture of pheromones. Normally, this wouldn't be an issue, except the one time the Disputatious Assembly had to play it before the Eubacteriarch gave a speech. The Assembly notaries had requisitioned a sizable quantity of the pheromones in advance, so they basically just cropdusted the meeting hall with it while he walked up. This is how it was discovered that the Vigotskian national anthem was a truth serum.</p>
<p>The Assembly quickly voted to adjourn until further notice.</p>
