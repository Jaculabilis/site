<div class="contentblock"><h1>Horseball</h1><p>Horseball is a sport in which players mounted on horses pass a ball between teammates while wearing oversized gloves, with the ultimate goal of scoring a point by throwing it into the opposing team's goal. The sport grew out of an <a  href="The_Ulgravian_Diaspora.html">Ulgravian</a> pastime, from before the country took to the skies, where mounted warriors would tie their shields concave-out to their hands and toss a ball to each other. The rules of horseball have been thoroughly systematized since those days, with glove size regulated and ball make standardized. Most institutions of secondary education will take their classes on a field trip to a horseball course, and many post-secondary institutions have horseball teams that bring in fans and provide scholarships.</p>
<p>Competitive horseball has been praised as uniting the venerable practice of horse breeding with the fast-paced action of other ball-type team sports, while retaining those qualities that allow fans to participate in the collective identity of their college, city, or country. Professional horseballers are widely regarded as celebrities. Because it requires a horse, of course, standard horseball is not a common leisure activity. Fans wanting to play it themselves will generally run around sans horse, ride on the shoulders of another player, or use roller skates. Rarely, amateur horseball is played on motorcycles, which is generally discouraged by the International Horseball Council (IHC).</p>
<p>While <a  href="Selestei.html">Selestei</a> does know of a sport by the name "horseball", it is not the same sport as played in the rest of the world. Instead of players on horses passing around a ball, Selesteine horseball involves players passing around a horse rolled up into a ball. Selesteine horseball teams are allowed to compete in the same brackets as international horseball teams through a byzantine set of adapter rules composed by <a class="phantom" href="High_Illuminator_Saint_Doctor_Heinrich_Stafford.html">the peerless Dr. Stafford</a>. Inexplicably, the matchup is quite balanced.</p>
<p>This benevolence came back to bite the international horseball community when Selestei won its first World Trough in 933. In the ensuing chaos of their victory/national anthem, the Selesteine team rolled the opposing team's horses into a giant ball and threw it into the audience. Inspired by this, Johnson, Johnson, & Several Other Johnsons, an <a  href="Incendia.html">Incendian</a> <a  href="Mad_legal_practice.html">mad lawyer cabal</a>, delved into Stafford's adapter rules and produced an extensively cross-referenced report a week later arguing that this was a legal move in adapted horseball. The 934 horseball season was subsequently dominated by the so-called "Selsroll" strategy until the IHC's own legal team could deconstruct JJ&SOJ's argument and restore a modicum of sensibility to the sport.</p>
<p>Selestei seems to be the only country to have gotten away with such an egregious perversion of the rules. When the <a  href="Lepazzia.html">Lepazzian</a> team's goal was suddenly found to have been <a  href="The_Esoteric_Order_of_Florists.html">filled with flowers</a> last year, preventing the other team from scoring, the Lepazzian team was politely asked to withdraw and suggested to refrain from entering for the next year.</p>
