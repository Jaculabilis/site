<div class="contentblock"><h1>Zor Olo</h1><p>Long revered for its eerie beauty, historical significance and association with magic, <b>Zor Olo</b> is the third and smallest moon.  But you don't care about that.  You're reading this article to find out why there's a giant fucking smiley face in the night sky, leering at you and scaring the snotty little bipedal consumerism batteries you call children.</p>
<p>First off, <a  href="Captain_Jango_22Space22_Gunnerson.html">researchers</a> are pretty sure that the moon didn't start out that way.  (Like, duh, it's a fucking ball of rock.  Smiley faces aren't natural fucking phenomena.)  The historical record puts it as one of the main inciting events for the <a  href="The_Roerbach_Incident.html">Roerbach Incident</a>.  So really the big puzzle is how it got that way.  How'd someone fuck up a moon eight hundred years before anyone made it to space?</p>
<p>Well, there's an easy answer and a hard answer.  The easy answer is we don't really know <i>how</i> it was done, so we probably don't have to worry about the same thing happening to one of the other moons, or to the planet.  Besides, it's been a long time, so we're probably done with that sort of thing happening again, right?  Yeah, well, <i>easy answers are for cowards</i>.</p>
<p>The hard answer is that we do know <i>why</i> it happened: fucking <a  href="Pantheons_of_Kingsland.html">Kingsland</a>.  ("We" here excludes the whole lot of <a  href="The_Hegemony_of_Whales.html">tumor-brained sea cows</a> who blame <a  href="Flandre.html">Flandre</a>.)  Shoulda been obvious in hindsight, really.  Like, their whole fucking shtick is "oh no, the stars are right, we're all doomed!"  And I get that y'all wanna just laugh the whole thing off, cuz when has an ancient Kingslander deity ever shown up and fucked up <i>your</i> front lawn?  </p>
<p>Well, it happened.  Apparently some kinda eldritch thingy showed up and they managed to seal it in the moon.  That's what caused the giant smily cracks.  It also <a  href="Missing_Sea.html">fucked up the ocean</a> despite the fact that <a  href="Barcuvian_antiweather.html">tides don't work that way</a>.</p>
<p>So here's the thingâ€”your dismissive, I-don't-wanna-worry-about-this-because-it-distracts-me-from-watching-television attitude is <i>ridiculously</i> stupid, because every night the tentacle-prints of some unspeakable horror play voyeur on your pathetic excuse for a sex life.  Just in case you weren't paying attention, we've got ancient Kingslander records saying the holes in the third moon happened because <i>the stars were right for once</i>.  Like, you wanna talk about butterfly effects?  What do you do when the butterfly is some eleventh-dimensional thing that can't eat us because the continents happen to be aligned in the right way?  <i>What the fuck do you think happens when you move them around</i>?</p>
