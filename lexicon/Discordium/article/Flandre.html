<div class="contentblock"><h1>Flandre</h1><p>There's no better introduction to the nation of <b>Flandre</b> than their own legendary origins: </p>
<hr><span class="signature"><p> <i>One day, Flan, god of foresight and confidence games, </i><br>
<i>ran out of opponents to play Catalos with, for the other<br>
gods had grown sick of losing all the time.</i> [Catalos is a <br>
Flandrean game, similar to chess except about twenty-<br>
seven times more complicated to play.]  <i>And so Flan</i><br>
<i>spoke, saying, Do I not possess great wisdom?  I shall</i><br>
<i>play against myself, and win great glory thereby.  But</i><br>
<i>Flan's mental might was too great, and as much as he </i><br>
<i>schemed, he could not outsmart himself.  Thus he had</i><br>
<i>an aneurysm and died.  But the gods had pity on Flan,</i><br>
<i>and from his body they made the world, and from his</i><br>
<i>urine they made the <a  href="The_Hegemony_of_Whales.html">seas</a>, and from his mind they</i><br>
<i>made humankind.  And they called themselves </i><br>
<i>"Flandre," which means "The Children of Flan."</i><br>
<br>
â€” From the <i><a class="phantom" href="The_Book_of_Schemes.html">Book of Schemes</a></i>, Ch. 8 verse 3-21.</p></span>

<p>I've always felt this story captures both the genius of the Flandrean spirit as well as the tendency for that genius to go wrong in unexpected ways.  And of course the story is in their own words, which I think is the only proper way to learn about a people.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is always room for the perspectives of others, such as the researchers who study the archeological record of the ancient Flandreans.  Flandrean ruins are easy to identify because they're usually chock-full of the remains of primitive booby traps.  Entries in the archeological record indicate that ancient Flandreans originated in the Barcu region before migrating to the territory currently claimed by the Methodocracy of Flandre.  This of course does much to explain the cultural paranoia of Flandre, for if you can't even trust the <a  href="Barcuvian_antiweather.html">weather</a>, what <i>can</i> you trust?  In fact, some researchers believe ancient Flandreans might have actually invented the concept of government in order to coordinate their contingency plans.</p>
<p>Historically, Flandre has proved a tricky diplomatic partner (see also the <a class="phantom" href="The_Roerbach_Incident.html">Roerbach Incident</a>), and the resulting trade deficit limited their economic growth.  It was only with the emergence of the Hegemony of Whales that their economy was able to boom, both as a result of oil trade and of renting space on their oil ships to nations that wish to avoid the Whale Tariffs.  Their cold war with the Hegemony of Whales has positioned them at the center of an anti-whale political bloc, along with the <a  href="The_Ulgravian_Diaspora.html">Ulgravian Diaspora</a>, whose zeppelin fleet creates an existential need for continued oil trade.</p>

<div class="contentblock"><p>The most hilarious thing about Flandre is their relationship to <a  href="Selestei.html">Selestei</a>.  The two countries are supposed to be allies.  Everyone over in Selestei loves Flandre, despite the fact that from a Selesteine point of view Flandrean culture is essentially institutionalized cowardice.  Meanwhile, Flandre appears to take every possible opportunity to fuck Selestei over.  But no matter how hard they try, Selestei somehow manages to avoid the vast majority of the negative consequences.  Not only that, but they don't even seem to have noticed this has been going on.  You should have seen <a  href="High_Exarch_Minor_Seraphi_Ironheart.html">Ironheart</a>'s eye twitching when Daggert gave her a bear hug last week, it was the most <i>hilarious</i> shit.</p>
