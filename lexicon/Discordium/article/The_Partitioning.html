<div class="contentblock"><h1>The Partitioning</h1><p>Some people like to troll entropologists by opening their slack-jawed, slobbering mouths and going "dur hur hur, society exhibits a trend of increasing centralization and interconnectivity, and as our horizons expand, more of society will be brought into harmony, so what do you think of <i>that?</i>"  Most recently I ran into this asinine sentiment from <a  href="Professor_Hazard_McKinley.html">Professor Hazard McKinley</a>, who I maintain is a literal sack of shit that someone throws across a room so they can submit the resulting splatter pattern to academic journals.</p>
<p>So the argument goes like this: everything tends toward unity and interconnectedness.  The more we centralize stuff, the fewer problems we have.  Centralization increases as time goes on.  Therefore, everything's going to turn out okay in the end.  So yeah, that argument?  Bullshit, all of it.  In reality, civilization's been going downhill since the invention of the nation-state.</p>
<p>That invention was called <b>the Partitioning</b>.  When the Partitioning went down, the <a  href="The_Venerable_Society_of_Cartographers.html">Guild of Mapmakers</a> had just been formed, and they were spreading their tendrils out all over the place to figure out how to represent the world.  And they were trying to deal with this issue of how do you look at the map and know who's in charge of a particular piece of land?  Hospitality culture was big back then—not anymore, of course, because everything goes to shit—and you had to know who you were bringing guest-gifts for. </p>
<p>So the Guild tried writing down the names of the big nations in the general area they were known to control.  This turns out not to work, since national land control ebbs and flows all the time.  So they went "fuck it" and just drew these big lines all over the map.  Bam, now <i>this</i> side is <a  href="Selestei.html">Selestei</a> and <i>that</i> side is <a  href="The_Ulgravian_Diaspora.html">Ulgrav</a>.  Easy peasy.</p>
<p>Problem is, before the Partitioning, no one gave a shit about who owned the land.  They cared about who owned what was <i>on</i> the land.  If you're an ancient Ulgravian horseprince, your main pre-Partition concerns look like this: "We need water.  Who do I kill to secure this river?  Should I have the horde graze on this hill?  How do we get around that <a class="phantom" href="Ominous_fixed-point_cubes.html">ominous floating cube</a>?"  But after the Partition, all of a sudden there's this invisible line down the middle of your grazing plains, and if you cross it King Musclebrain the Painfully Loud sends the <a  href="Grim_Weepers.html">Grim Weepers</a> after you.</p>
<p>I always get pissed off by these soft-skulled armchair theorists who hail the Partitioning as a great thing because it eliminated the constant tribal war.  Tribal wars are small and over concrete, finite things like water.  But after you invent states, it becomes possible to go to war because your fucking Sovereign <a  href="The_War_of_Durun27s_Ass.html">isn't satisfied with the size of his genitalia</a>.  Have you ever <i>met</i> a Sovereign who was secure in their genitalia size?  It was a fucking mistake to let states own land and we should undo the whole thing.</p>
