<div class="contentblock"><h1>Joint University Strike Team for Interdisciplinary Collaboration Enforcement</h1><p>Following the invention of the <a  href="The_Dark_Pentad.html">dark degrees</a> in the mid-ninth century, there was considerable tension between regular academia and dark academia. This was understandable, as the dark degrees were institutional brands of shame, and some universities even began exiling their dark academics to <a  href="Xenoarcheological_ruins.html">the south pole</a>. Despite their professional disgrace, however, the work of dark academics was still recognized, implicitly or off the record, as containing some insights of worth, and thus a limited amount of interdisciplinary work was done between the burgeoning dark disciplines and regular academia. This work was stymied by several incidents where dark academics attempted to use the collaboration to taint the reputations of their peers.</p>
<p>In order to safeguard the extraction of value from the work of dark academia and protect regular academics from their erstwhile colleagues, several universities formed the Council for Interdisciplinary Collaboration in 856, which mediated interactions with dark academics in order to prevent them from taking down regular academics out of spite. This continued until 891, when the Vulterbase could not be brought to heel in the wake of the <a  href="Goats_on_Boats_Affair.html">Goats on Boats Affair</a>. Over the next few decades, the Council requested, and was approved for, an increasing amount of military power in order to bring the Vulterbase rebels to justice. By 931, the Council had become a globally-ranked military power and rebranded itself as the <b>Joint University Strike Team for Interdisciplinary Collaboration Enforcement</b>, aka JUSTICE. Turns out that your army has a nice tech advantage if it's literally made of the people who do military tech research.</p>
<p>In addition to power creep, the scope of the former Council's duties has also expanded beyond their original duties of keeping Pentads in line. JUSTICE also works security at research conventions, provides military defense to universities when necessary, and hunts down rogue academics who need to be eliminated. To date, very few academics have escaped their fury once roused. Sadly, as an international and interinstitutional body, they are vulnerable to bureaucracy, which is why they have yet to get permission to enter the campus of the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns to capture our own Spheven Kain. I keep giving them tips on him, but it seems he never leaves the building, so they can't grappling-hook him off the neutral ground. I'm hoping he'll slip up one of these days. If they finally get him because of me, I'll score a lot of points with them, which I need because they aren't exactly fans of my work. I guess I'm not making a lot of friends by writing papers in defense of oppressive autocrats, but what else am I supposed to use tenure for? Writing about the same "unpopular" topics everyone else is writing about to show off how progressive and daring they are? Bullshit. If tenure isn't the only thing between you and a JUSTICE tribunal, you're wasting your career.</p>

<div class="contentblock"><p>The suits over at JUSTICE "aren't exactly fans of [Rubric's] work" because the last time <a  href="Queen_Beneficent_the_Plenitudinous.html">someone</a> put her ideas into practice, every university in the country was emptied and replaced with propaganda offices. Why hasn't JUSTICE been after her for years already? Sure, she lives and works in Kingsland, so it's understandable why nobody wants to go after her there. But she commutes to the DAS campus for Butterfly Effect Advisory meetings, doesn't she? How many countries does she have to indirectly destroy before someone wises up and puts her on a wanted list?</p>
<p>Well, I'm not just going to sit around and wait for it. You should really invest in a better lock for that secret drawer in your desk, Cincinatta. I've read your notes about having the <a  href="Taurus_Research_Station.html">Taurus</a> capture the <a  href="Zeitgeist_Manipulator.html">Zeitgeist Manipulator</a> from orbit so you can reprogram it to make everyone agree with your ideas. Real clever, how you plan to circumvent the psychological barriers to stopping it that the Manipulator creates. Not so clever leaving the plan where I could find it. I wonder what JUSTICE will think of your little conspiracy when I fax it to them?</p>

<div class="contentblock"><p>Good luck faxing Kingsland-made paper! Even if they manage to subdue the horrifying, betantacled monstrosity that comes out on their end, they won't be able to read any of the writing through the eldritch sigils that appear all over it. Don't worry, I'll let them know you were the one who sent it. Maybe that'll teach you not to eat my goddamn caramel corn at night.</p>
