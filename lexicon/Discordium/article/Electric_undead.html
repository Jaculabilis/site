<div class="contentblock"><h1>Electric undead</h1><p>I got woken up at 3 AM this morning when a moaning corpse started pounding on my door.  I still don't have any idea how the fuck it got on this zeppelin.  Zeppelin security took like four hours to deal with it, and in the meantime I just had to sit there and think about how much sleep I wasn't getting.  It's been a shitty day.</p>
<p>The <b>electric undead</b>, like every horrible thing, hail from the Barcu region.  About fifteen hundred years ago, they started spreading.  The ones that went north froze, and the ones that went south found out the hard way that <a  href="Flandre.html">Flandre</a> already had a National Response Protocol for dealing with contagious animated corpses.  But in the east was the warrior kingdom of Hantu.  Don't bother looking them up, they're all zombies now.  The morons found out that the electric undead spread through electrical contact, and all their swords were made of metal, and they <i>still</i> sent everyone at the rotting horde.</p>
<p>Despite the constant menace throughout history, we didn't make any progress understanding what was going on with the electric undead until the turn of the century, when none other than <a class="phantom" href="High_Illuminator_Saint_Doctor_Heinrich_Stafford.html">Dr. Stafford</a> happened to them.  His research temple captured a few of them and vivisected them with ceramic tools, which allowed them to discover that the electrical activity in their nervous systems was actually <a  href="Barcuvian_antiweather.html">antilightning</a>, which explained why they act so weird.  Dr. Stafford's research allowed the Disuptatious Assembly of Sovereigns to pass the Electric Undead Quarantine Act.  Initially they wanted to drive the zombies into the sea, but the <a  href="The_Hegemony_of_Whales.html">whales</a> weren't having it.  So instead they tried to set up a fucking containment line on the Barcuvian border.  The Flandreans kept trying to set up protective measures, since <i>their</i> government has an entropology research division, but no one else wanted to spend the money and the Hegemon kept blocking them out of spite.</p>
<p>Look no further for proof that the DAS is full of idiots.  We've got this thing in entropology called "Chaos Theory," which is a theory that makes the following prediction: <i>If it causes chaos, it will happen</i>.  So at least none of <i>us</i> were surprised when one day <a  href="Professor_28allegedly29_Marvin_Fitch.html">that Fitch fucker</a> tried to <a  href="X-treme_lecturing.html">sneak his students through the containment zone</a> and ended up letting all the zombies out into the world.  Now the rest of us have to deal with fucking zombies on our fucking zeppelins disrupting our fucking beauty sleep.  Fuck him.</p>
