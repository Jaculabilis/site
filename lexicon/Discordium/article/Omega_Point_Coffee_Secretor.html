<div class="contentblock"><h1>Omega Point Coffee Secretor</h1><p>The <b>Omega Point Coffee Secretor</b> is the bane of my existence. Its hulking, industrial carapace takes up a full half of the Butterfly Effect Advisory Committee's break room. On Tuesdays, it emits a constant hum that resonates with all of the silverware, making the conference room next to the break room impossible to do any work in on account of the clattering. The user interface is badly designed, and half of the buttons "accidentally" trip safety overrides, making the machine capable of causing serious injury to its operator. A non-negligible percent of the time, it turns the cup into coffee instead of filling it. There's no place to remove the used coffee grounds, but it never runs out of room no matter how much more we keep adding, and some of the Committee members are starting to worry about where it's all going. And yet, it makes the best damn coffee you ever tasted. It's infuriating.</p>
<p>Say what you will about the <a  href="Professor_28allegedly29_Marvin_Fitch.html">alleged professor</a>, and I certainly do, but he was one clever sonnuvabitch. The OPCS is a technological marvel capable of dispensing coffee to any point within a hundred feet through what IT tells us is a wormhole similar to the one created by a <a  href="Symphonic_warp_traversal.html">Grimer Primer</a>. Having warp technology in the break room has been deemed a major workplace safety violation, but none of the office supervisors have been able to get its removal approved, because it's on record as being the property of <a  href="Placeholden.html">Placeholden</a>, and moving it would require getting the sovereign thereof to sign off on the move. Not that getting the signature would help; the uninstall manual has <a  href="F09F9487.html">ðŸ”‡</a> in it.</p>
<p>The Secretor makes some non-coffee beverages, too, but its performance is less consistent doing them. When I figured out where the cream soda menu was, instead of filling the cup I had put into the cup receptacle, it filled all of the cups in the cupboards, then added cream to Gwen's coffee in the next room. While it is technically capable of making hot chocolate, it seems to only recognize toilet bowls as valid containers for it. <a class="phantom" href="DAS_Secretary_Ruby_Tomas.html">The Secretary</a> loves hot chocolate, so eventually she just started bringing a toilet-shaped novelty mug when she comes by for meetings. Some of the dysfunctions are fairly useful for other purposes, as well: the steamed milk options actually launch seek-and-destroy missiles, which came in handy the one time Cincinatta let a <a  href="Marionette_children.html">marionette child</a> into the Committee wing of the building.</p>

<div class="contentblock"><p>Sadly, though the Omega Point Coffee Secretor seems to be able to do anything, the terrible user interface has so far stymied Kain's efforts to find out how to have it make him a shower &mdash; or so I assume is the reason he smells like he sleeps in the janitorial closet.</p>
<p>Wait, wasn't he fired? Why do I keep seeing him in the office?</p>

<div class="contentblock"><p>I didn't <i>let it in</i>. It had a valid ID card. I just held the door open for it because its hands were full. But sure, <i>I'm</i> the villain here for being polite to a coworker, and not the people who <i>shot it down with surface-to-air missiles</i>. Take a diversity seminar or something, you <i>bigots</i>.</p>

<div class="contentblock"><p>Rubric, he smells like he sleeps in the janitorial closet because he fucking sleeps in the janitorial closet.  He basically admitted as much in his <a  href="General_Kade_22Ripper22_Gorson.html">article on Gorson</a>.  AND he keeps taking my favorite couch.</p>

<div class="contentblock"><p>I'm sure this is all just a misunderstanding, my friends.  I was also concerned about Mr. Kain showing up in the break room from time to time, but he assured me that he's just clearing his things out and he'll be done any day now.  Besides, he <i>is</i> the janitor, you know.  He told me there's a lot of paperwork involved, or so he tells me, which is why he's on our computers all the time.  I'm sure we can allow it out of respect for a former colleague. </p>
