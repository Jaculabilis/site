<div class="contentblock"><h1>The I'll Legislate It, I Swear, Don't Think I Won't Act</h1><p>Remember when the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns was good at their jobs?  I don't.  There hasn't been a decent Assembly since like AES 26 when Jain Kantamon <a class="phantom" href="The_Roerbach_Incident.html">convinced the international community that dragons were a thing</a>.  Even then, well, the idiots all thought that dragons existed.</p>
<p>So there's this thing in entropology called Angrand's Equation, which describes the efficacy of government as a function of the time since its founding.  Unsurprisingly to anyone who knows about entropology, the graph just keeps going downward.  You meatheads think the Assembly is any different?  Then read 'em and fucking weep, because either you don't know about the <b>I'll Legislate it, I Swear, Don't Think I Won't Act</b>, or your TV-rotted excuse for a brain is in too much of a stupor to understand the implications.</p>
<p>The ILIISDTIWA is, simply put, the nadir of not just the Assembly, but also of <i>civilization in general</i>.  It started with some wag deciding to curb the power of the <a class="phantom" href="The_Esoteric_Order_of_Florists.html">Esoteric Order of Florists</a>, never mind that all they do is deliver fucking flowers to hard-to-reach areas, and never mind that if your jumped-up, fancy-pants "national security" can't stop a bunch of florists there's no way they'll listen when a gaggle of politicians tells them off for it.  Whatever.  Tale as old as time.</p>
<p>So next thing that happens is people start adding on all these other riders to the Act.  And I'll give them this: the founders of the Assembly knew this was going to be a problem, so there are provisions in the Charter that force people to remain at least notionally on topic when they try to stick their overbearing regal genitals in a piece of legislation.  But look at the fucking title on this piece of shit!  Can you think of anything you <i>can't</i> legislate with a title like that?  "Hur hur, what about legislating not thinking they won't" <i>no dice, you corpulent weasel, the fuckers did that too</i>.</p>
<p>Even the shit that went wrong didn't go right, because the Assembly is full of opportunists who want to find a nice, convenient legislative vehicle to outlaw their favorite pet peeve.  The I'll Legislate It Act opened the floodgates on a tsunami of excrement.  There were sections that outlawed voting with your left hand, and lunchtime, and famously even <i>other sections of the same fucking Act</i>.  And so of course it got to the point where nobody actually wanted this legislative atrocity to go through, because their own citizens would have them drawn and quartered.  But they had also spent way too many favors getting this thing set up, so they couldn't vote against.  So on voting day, one by one, every stinkin' Sovereign in the building voted to abstain.  But they forgot one critical detail: <a  href="Lepazzia.html">Lepazzia</a> always votes in favor.</p>
<p>I don't wanna think about this anymore, so I'm gonna get shitfaced.  Smell ya later.</p>
