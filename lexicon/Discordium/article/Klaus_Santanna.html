<div class="contentblock"><h1>Klaus Santanna</h1><p><b>Klaus Santanna</b> is one of the dreadful spawn of Kingsland, and one of the few phenomena of our city to turn its sights beyond the city limits. In the last century, it has risen to international attention as the sovereign of the Compass Republic, which it rules from its throne in <a  href="The_Double-North_Pole.html">Bipolaris</a>. The true extent of Santanna's power is unknown, but it is sufficient to maintain the order of the Republic without having a legal code. It can mind control people it's touched and seems to possess some form of clairvoyance, allowing it to see anything that goes on in its realm. Despite its unnatural vigor and vitality and its ability to levitate without any visible means, Santanna rarely moves from its throne and conducts most business through proxies. It is represented in the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns by a mechanical doll, which <a class="phantom" href="DAS_Secretary_Ruby_Tomas.html">the Secretary</a> throws out every month for exceeding the permissible duration of proxy representation. Because of its reclusiveness, rumors abound as to its true, terrifying appearance. Those who know are few, and they cannot be trusted.</p>
<p>These days, the Compass Republic is a big name on the international stage for the global scale of its manufacturing. Soap, folding chairs, kitchenware, all sorts of miscellanea and knickknacks &mdash; you probably have some Compass goods in your house right now. The stirring sticks in the Butterfly Effect Advisory Committee's break room are Compass-produced, which is why I bring my own stick from home. Look, I know we Kingslanders are a sorry lot when it comes to avoiding terrible things, even though most of the time there's no choice we can make that doesn't end up terribly. But my grandparents say that we breathed a godsdamned sigh of relief when Klaus Santanna left town. Its <a  href="Pantheons_of_Kingsland.html">cult</a> even thought the <a  href="Tesseraction_Eve.html">Tesseraction</a> was upon us, grabbed their weapons, and marched into a dark alleyway, which really tied up a lot of loose ends. 'course, then we started hearing things about what Santanna was up to in the Compass Republic, and then it became the bloody sovereign. At least it's menacing far away from us, so we can focus on all the menacing things closer to home.</p>
<p>Still, there's one Kingslander who isn't happy with Santanna being only that far away. I wish <a  href="Captain_Jango_22Space22_Gunnerson.html">Jango Gunnerson</a> all the best in his quest to find the <a class="phantom" href="Ultimate_Dragonopolis.html">Ultimate Dragonopolis</a>, which is probably one of the only things that could stop Santanna if it began taking a more active interest in global politics.</p>
