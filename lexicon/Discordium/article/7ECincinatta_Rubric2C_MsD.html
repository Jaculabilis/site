<div class="contentblock"><h1>~Cincinatta Rubric, MsD</h1><p><i><b>Dr. Cincinatta Rubric, MsD</b> is the Centus Havocwreaker Professor Emeritus of Misosophy at the National Correspondence University of Incendia and the author of several acclaimed books, including </i>The Profitable Abuse of Hypotheticals<i> and the groundbreaking textbook </i>Corrupting the Youth<i>. She was demerited with a Doctorate of Misosophy for her achievements in the egregious violation of scholarly norms and remorseless sabotage of her academic opponents, and subsequently recognized by her peers as a dangerous and unhinged maverick when she actually showed up to her misosophy degree conferral. Her work in the field of combat philosophy has been denounced by several major journals of philosophy, and she has the prestigious honor of being the first Pentad academic to receive a restraining order from an official conference of the Notional Academy of Barcu. Her appointment to the Butterfly Effect Advisory Committee passed by a 3 vote margin and provoked an official letter of protest from the High Exarch Minor of Flandre.</i></p>
<p><i>Dr. Rubric enjoys fencing, mountain biking, and the panicked consternation of freshmen. When she is not at the Assembly on Committee business, she lives in her condo in Kingsland South with her pet snake Rufus and something that lives in the walls that she refuses to name, because to name it would be to acknowledge its presence.</i></p>
