# Title: High Exarch Minor Seraphi Ironheart

After [[the stunt she pulled in 986|986 Bring Your Daughter to Work Day incident]], the "whale bloc" of the Disputatious Assembly began planning for her eventual Exarchy, since someone who can decapitate a continent in an afternoon will end up ruling Flandre one way or another. The [[988 snake invasion|Buddy "Literally Made of Snakes" Johnson]], therefore, became a matter of international concern, not only because it threw the Flandrean-headed anti-whale coalition into disarray, but also because the succession crisis threatened to bring Seraphi to power much earlier than anticipated. With Flandre's coalition leaderless, [[the Very Definitely Independent States]], still smarting from Seraphi's machinations, motioned for the Assembly to respond by annihilating //both// sides of the civil war. The rest of the whale bloc gave its support, fearing the prospect of a recovered Flandre under a High Exarch Minor Ironheart. Flandre was at its most vulnerable, and if they did not strike while they had the chance, having another would be doubtful. The shaken coalition, on the other hand, feared the prospect of the whale bloc figuratively (or literally) rolling over them, and the ensuing political deadlock lasted long enough that Seraphi Ironheart could ascend as High Exarch Minor and settle the matter in the Assembly herself.
