# Title: ~Remilion Christophy, PhD

//**Dr. Remilion Christophy, PhD** is an independent researcher in the field of sociophysics, which he insists is a legitimate field of study. His seminal work //The King Electric: The Influence of Electromagnetic Variance on Order and Revolution// is widely considered by sociologists and physicists. He achieved international renown during his presidency over the 988 Butterfly Effect Advisory Committee that advised the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns on the civil unrest in Flandre following the death of the High Exarch. His knack for applying the systems analysis of physical science to the social dynamics of succession came to the fore during the Committee's debate over whether to recommend the annihilation of //both// sides of the conflict. Though Christophy's peers have found great success in using physical metaphors according his method, he continues to insist that his theories only make sense when interpreted literally. This has yet to catch on.//

//Dr. Christophy is a voting member of the International Ignitennis Council and boasts an illustrated college career. He spends his free time reading science fiction and occasionally writes for scifi conventions. When he isn't pursuing his sociophysical research, he works as a librarian in Anathema Vale, Flandre, to continue the work of his late wife.//
