# Title: The Contagious Republic of Paul Vigotski

No one messes with the concept of nationhood like **Paul Vigotski**.  He's the only person with a seat in the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns who is not actually a Sovereign.  That's because the real Sovereign is the Eubacteriarch, a sentient bacterium that lives in Paul's nasal cavity.  The only academics more fascinated than the biologists are, of course, the memetosociologists, because Paul Vigotski invites the incredibly pressing question "how did this man get recognized as a nation?"

According to interviews with the Eubacteriarch, the Contagious Republic of Paul Vitgotski began with a bacterial infection that evolved sentience at the microbial level.  At the time of the Republic's formation, the Republic numbered around 3 million in population.  Each citizen was given one vote, to be shared by the descendants of that citizen after they underwent asexual reproduction.  Nowadays the Contagious Republic's population numbers around 230 trillion, making it the most populous nation on earth.  This makes votes in the Republic a highly scare commodity, often resulting in unrest that manifests as stomachaches.

The Contagious Republic's appearance on the National Stage came at an opportune moment, right as the [[Very Definitely Independent States]] began their propaganda campaign for independence.  The bacterium of the Republic worked out a way to hijack Vigotski's sensory and motor neurons, allowing for communication between the miniature Republic and the outside world.  In a speech before the Disputatious Assembly, the Eubacteriarch made its case for statehood, appropriating rhetoric used by the VIDS and their allies to all but ensure the support of that bloc.  Therefore, just as the VDIS were granted some dubious measure of statement, the Contagious Republic also managed to win a seat.

Elevating Paul Vigotski to statehood caused no end of political shenanigans.  Foremost of these was Vigotski's status as a citizen of [[Selestei]], which made the bacteria's colonization of him technically count as an act of war.  Unfortunately for Selestei, while the Contagious Republic compelled Vigotski to sneeze on every door handle he encountered, the Selesteines could only prosecute the war by forcing Vigtoski to take antibiotics.  Vigotski, who was enjoying the media attention, refused.  The war continued in a subdued sort of manner for three years until both nations attended the [[Massively Parallel Peace Conference]] and settled on a compromise whereby Vigotski was awarded dual citizenship in both nations.

Today, the Contagious Republic has 32 human citizens, each of which hosts legions of bacterial researchers, artists, and businessgerms.  As such, the Republic's scientific, cultural, and financial output is nearly on par with nations with a much higher human population, and its GDP per capita is the best in the world.
