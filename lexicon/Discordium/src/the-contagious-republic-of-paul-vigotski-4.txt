# Title: The Contagious Republic of Paul Vigotski

Ah, yes, I remember there was something of a conundrum in the 50's because it seemed like Vigotski himself was getting up there in years.  Everyone was wondering if they'd rename the country after whoever the Eubacteriarch colonized after Vigotski and what would happen to the voting populations that inhabited Vigotski's body.  But it seems like the Republic cracked the secret of cellular regeneration, since Vigotski hasn't aged a day in decades.  Once people figured it out, they were extremely eager to acquire the secret, but the Republic told everyone that they'd need to be colonized for the trick to work.  Interest died out after that.  The older I get, the more I think about taking the offer, but my wife has expressly forbid me from infecting myself just to live forever.  //C'est la vie!//
