# Title: The Ulgravian Diaspora

It certainly seems that Flandre is aware of the potential for betrayal from Ulgrav.  At a meeting of the Assembly yesterday, I watched [[High Exarch Minor Ironheart|High Exarch Minor Seraphi Ironheart]] stroll across the Chamber of Sovereigns, whisper in the Ulgravian Sovereign's ear, then slam a knife through his desk before walking away.  The message seemed to be, "If you cross us and fail, you'd better hope //you// have a contingency plan."  Knowing you're in the crosshairs of the most paranoid nation on the planet is a good motivator to try your luck in other directions.
