# Title: The Contagious Republic of Paul Vigotski

The Contagious Republic has probably caused more pain to bureaucrats and paper-pushers than any other country in the Assembly. Their population is several digits wider than any other country's, making it a pain to display in tables. Their ambassadors live inside some of their citizens, making the person of the citizen, properly speaking, the embassy. This means that to mail something to a Vigotskian embassy, one needs the mailing address where the embassy is currently staying. And because they're a nation primarily of microorganisms, instead of singing for their national anthem, they all release a particular mixture of pheromones. Normally, this wouldn't be an issue, except the one time the Disputatious Assembly had to play it before the Eubacteriarch gave a speech. The Assembly notaries had requisitioned a sizable quantity of the pheromones in advance, so they basically just cropdusted the meeting hall with it while he walked up. This is how it was discovered that the Vigotskian national anthem was a truth serum.

The Assembly quickly voted to adjourn until further notice.
