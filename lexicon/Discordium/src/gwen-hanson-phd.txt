# Title: ~Gwen Hanson, PhD

//**Dr. Gwen Hanson, PhD** is the head of the Entropology Department at the Transient University of Ulgrav, where she has worked for the past eleven years.  She received a Masters degree (with honors) from the University of Hejilad, and completed her doctorate work with the Townsend Foundation with a groundbreaking thesis on why the Botherhood can't possibly get anything done.//

//Entropology had long been something of a niche academic field until Dr. Hanson brought it into prominence with the popular nonfiction book "Why Everything Goes to Shit" in AS 986.  The work introduced an entry-level understanding of entropology to the general populace, which seemed like a good thing until it, inevitably, went to shit.  Now she can't walk down the street without hearing morons butchering her life's work in casual conversations.  Fuck all of you.//

//As an academic and professor, Dr. Hanson has won the respect of both colleagues and students.  She was awarded the Ngote Award for Professorial Excellence in AS 988, a highly coveted decoration given to a professor by majority student vote.  She has successfully defended against no less than four accusations of misosophy, even managing to reflect the humiliation on her accuser in three of those cases.//

//Today, she lives with her husband and two children aboard the Ulgravian zeppelin //Thunder Bumble// until such time as the fucking Sovereign manages to get someone to sell us some fucking land.//
