# Title: General Kade "Ripper" Gorson

Though he is known to posterity as //General// Ripper, Kade Gorson began his service in the Flandrean Navy, where he fought in the Cetacean Wars aboard the cruiser //Blade Awaiting//, which he captained by the end of the Wars. In the 30s, Gorson's fleet assisted [[J.U.S.T.I.C.E.|Joint University Strike Team for Interdisciplinary Collaboration Enforcement]] in offensives against the Vulterbase rebels occupying the [[xenoarcheological ruins]] at the south pole. His experiences fighting against the rebels' alien-derived technology would later form the basis of his advocacy for arming the [[Taurus Research Station]]. After the Taurus weaponization, the Hegemony of Whales banned him from the oceans, and Flandre, weighing the options, transferred him from the navy to the army.
