# Title: Ultimate Dragonopolis

So there's this thing in [[Ulgravian|The Ulgravian Diaspora]] culture that most outsiders never catch on to.  The question is this: fast, or old?  Remember that we're a horse people with a rich sense of history who all live on zeppelins now.  As an Ulgravian, that puts you in one of two camps: either your ship has a ton of history, but its technical specs are shit; or it's modern and sleek but you've got no fucking history to ground yourself in, pun not fucking intended.  Or you have the shit luck to be born on the //Thunder Bumble//, which astoundingly has neither history nor half-decent specs, and do you know what a fucking pain in the ass it is to petition for a ship transfer in the Ulgravian Diaspora?

Anyway, so there's these ancient legends about the **Ultimate Dragonopolis**, the last city of the dragons.  And they seemed like pure myth for most of history, but ever since we invented space travel people are giving those myths another look and realizing that a lot of the details look an awful fucking lot like what you'd see on an atmosphere-capable space vessel.  But since academics have their head perpetually up their asses and/or in the sand, our biggest researcher on this topic is [[a half-mad conspiracy theorist|Captain Jango "Space" Gunnerson]] with a vendetta against [[the country that fucking gives us all affordable household goods|The Double-North Pole]].  Worse, he's being bankrolled by the wireheads in fucking [[Shaster]], who probably only want in because they want to feel like their country is actually relevant on the global stage.

You know who really needs an extra airship?  How about //the only country in the world that actually lives on airships?// The Ultimate Dragonopolis is huge, according the legends&mdash;hell, fucking dragons lived on it, what else would you expect?&mdash;and its tech level is beyond anything we've got, judging by the shit the dragons left behind in their [[little antarctic getaway|Xenoarcheological ruins]]. We'd treasure the shit outta that thing if we got our hands on it.  I mean, shit, the Ulgravians over on //Falcon of the Plains// go everywhere on the ship by swinging from monkey bars because it's carpeted in rugs belonging to the last Dragon Prince and they're too holy for anyone else to walk on.  Plus, we've got a claim to the dragonopolis.  The Ulgravians are the only people in the world who remember that horses are descended from dragons.  We fucking tamed them, and don't give me that shit about how no one outside of Ulgrav believes those accounts.  Probably wouldn't recognize a legitimate historical narrative if a [[Selesteine|Selestei]] beat your face in with it.  So it stands to reason&mdash;not that any of you self-interested horsewives at the Assembly are gonna give more than the semblance of thought on this&mdash;that whatever the dragons had is now ours by right.

//Give us the fucking spaceship!//
