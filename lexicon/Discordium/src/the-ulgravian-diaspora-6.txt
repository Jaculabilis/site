Guess what, Pierce?  I saw it.  Fuck you.

As far as "other directions" are concerned, I happen to know that the Sovereign received a diplomatic party from the [[germs|The Contagious Republic of Paul Vigotski]] the other week.  Flandre aside, their tech is the best on offer right now, with the //poooossible// exception of the [[Panark Fleet|The Panark Fleet]].  We're nominally allied with the Fleet, but one reason to pick the Vigotskians over the Fleet is if you're trying to look for alternate energy sourcesâ€”the boatfuckers oppose the Act and they're mortal enemies with the [[Hegemony|The Hegemony of Whales]], so they've never had as much of an incentive to pursue that line of research.

If the Sovereign can land some kind of research deal and reduce our dependence on Flandrean oil, we might see some changes in the alliance.  At the very least, it'll be less of a headlock for us.
