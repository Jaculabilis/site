# Title: High Exarch Minor Seraphi Ironheart

In the [[Methodocracy of Flandre|Flandre]], it is not just the strong who survive.  The strong are often overconfident, so they don't prepare enough for eventual failure.  Flandreans instead celebrate the //crafty//, who so often bring down the strong,  and Flandrean institutions reflect that fact faithfully.

Methodocracy, or "rule by schemes," is by design a difficult-to-understand system of government.  In fact, many of the protocols of the Methodocracy are kept confidential to prevent exploitation by external or internal powers.  However, it is known that the High Exarch is chosen not on the basis of any personal merit, but based on whether their proposed solution to the current national crisis is more effective than the others.  Nominally this would include a proposal from the current High Exarch, but High Exarchs have a habit of coincidentally winding up dead whenever a situation rises to the level of a nation crisis.

You can read more about **High Exarch Minor Seraphi Ironheart**'s ascension in Dr. Rubric's [[treatment|Flandrean National Response Protocol BX-392a]] of the Inordinate Number of Snakes protocol, but my topic here is Ironheart's conduct as High Exarch Minor.

Consider, for example, the case of a 12-year-old whose defense proposal was rejected by the Council.  For most little girls, that would be the end of their political endeavors, for that is the way society tells them that the process works.  Soon-to-be-HEM Ironheart instead traveled north to Kingsland—foolhardy in its own right—persuaded an [[eldritch abomination|The Killer Bus of Kingsland North]] to participate in her scheme, and then barbecued half the Council with a flamethrower while riding atop said eldritch abomination.  Rubric writes "they could not argue with the results"—indeed, indeed!  It was a brilliant political move, for not only did she demonstrate the worthiness of her proposal, but she also boldly demonstrated that the Council didn't have a contingency plan for getting baked alive.

Now 14, Ironheart's leadership has remained no less decisive or flashy.  Most controversial, of course, was her decision to establish a military base on the lip of the [[Missing Sea]] as a foothold for research and colonization.  Ironheart correctly identified that Flandre was the only nation in a position both to exploit the resources on the open sea floor and to stave off the wrath of the whales that would follow such a course.  And the public relations strategies she employed to address, mollify, rebut, and/or disappear her detractors once again demonstrate the deftness of her contingency planning.

While there are several obvious reasons of practicality underlying Flandre's resistance to the Disarrangement Act, proponents of the Act might consider that they do not want an irritated High Exarch Minor Seraphi Ironheart on their borders.
