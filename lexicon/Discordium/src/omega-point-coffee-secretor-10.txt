I'm sure this is all just a misunderstanding, my friends.  I was also concerned about Mr. Kain showing up in the break room from time to time, but he assured me that he's just clearing his things out and he'll be done any day now.  Besides, he //is// the janitor, you know.  He told me there's a lot of paperwork involved, which is why he's on our computers all the time.  I'm sure we can allow it out of respect for a former colleague.
