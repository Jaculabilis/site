# Title: Selestei

Despite its militarily aggressive history, modern Selestei is actually quite a charming place to visit. The weather at the major vacation destinations is temperate, which the locals attribute to intimidating the climate into submission. When I visited many years back, I had one of the best curries I've had in my life in the city market. I was a little embarrassed to order the minimum spice level, but the lady running the stall could tell I was a foreigner and insisted. I tried to convince her that it was no use and that sociophysical principles would make it more or less spicy according to expectation, but in the end I'm glad I took her advice, because //damn// was that a hot curry. According to my wife, I was mumbling in my sleep all night about contracting [[jalape√±osis]].

Of course, Selesteine cuisine isn't all spicy food, whatever legends of their [[elite troops|Grim Weepers]] might suggest. There's a city in the north of the country famous for its pastries, which food critics attribute partially to the recipe and partially to how well the dough is kneaded. The bakeries are all located near a military base, and the soldiers there knead the dough by practicing hand-to-hand combat on it. They have a festival every year where they bake swords and shields out of bread, which the children of the town use to stage mock battles.
