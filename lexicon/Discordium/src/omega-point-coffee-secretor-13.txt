Awful lot of my favorite snacks missing from the break room cupboards every night for a night janitor who's "just clearing his things out". If he needs some wheels greased to finish the job, I'd be happy to oblige. As in, I just found the Secretor's grease menu, and it's got all sorts of grease in it. Wheel grease, elbow grease, you name it, it greases it. Honestly, I just want to see if this grease menu works. Anyone have a squeaky chair and/or deep fryer?
