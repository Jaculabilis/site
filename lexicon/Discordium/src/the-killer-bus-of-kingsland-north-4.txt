# Title: The Killer Bus of Kingsland North

In a happy example of partisan agreement, the Killer Bus's candidacy for sovereign is also supported by [[the Hegemony of Whales]], for much the same reasons as its support for the fragmentation of [[the Very Definitely Independent States]] in the 30s. The mayor of Kingsland has expressed uncertainty as to the Killer Bus's candicacy: on one hand, the Bus would take up two rows of seats, giving Kingsland unprecedented voting power in the Disputatious Assembly; on the other hand, it would mean he would have to go back to living in Kingsland.

In my personal opinion, the mayor should stop being such a sissy and move back. My neighbors got eaten by something last summer and the flat's been vacant long enough that I'm sure whatever did it has moved on. It's the least sacrifice he could make for his country. Over here in Kingsland South, we'd kill to get that many Assembly votes, and I can't imagine how the Northerners would feel to have the Killer Bus off the streets.
