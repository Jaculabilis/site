# Title: The Lunchtime Fallacy

The Lunchtime Fallacy has accumulated an impressive //curriculum vitae// of prestigious events. They've played at the inaugurations of the Mayor of Kingsland, the President of [[Incendia]], and several of the governors of [[the Very Definitely Independent States]]. They've provided background music to sessions of the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns and breakout meetings of the Advisory Committees. They were even invited once!
