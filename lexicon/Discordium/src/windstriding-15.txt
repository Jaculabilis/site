Say, Gwen, do people ever fall off the windstriding rope on purpose? Like, if someone were trying to clandestinely parachute into a country without [[JUSTICE|Joint University Strike Team for Interdisciplinary Collaboration Enforcement]] extradition, or escape arrest. This is all hypothetical, I'm just asking for... academic purposes.
