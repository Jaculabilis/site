# Title: ~Dr. Herbert Jones

//As a young man of eight, **Herbert Jones** surprised his parents by taking apart the family encyclopedia and rearranging the articles in order of geographic proximity to their Walksford home.  Sixty years and seven academic positions later, he has not lost that early enthusiasm for rearranging humanity's knowledge into shapes that suit us better.//

//Dr. Jones is a prolific author, having published over thirty volumes of nonfiction, including //Where to Put the Shit//—an exhaustive treatise on how architects place restrooms when designing buildings—as well as the celebrated trilogy //Venereal Diseases of the Great Historians, Vol. I-III.//  He also made history by publishing the first fully fictional encyclopedia, //The Fairfax Guide to Other Places,// which won the Greentemple Award for Creative Fiction in AS 973.//

//Dr. Jones's career has been marked by academic success in addition to literary.  After winning a Staff of Mastery from the Yuglandian College of Hysteria's Inventory Department, he pursued a doctorate education at the University of Eyesland.  There he studied Miscellania under the legendary Riggs Behemon, who remained a close friend and mentor until his death in AS 982.  Dr. Jones's doctorate thesis was adapted into the //Herbert Jones Encyclopedia of Precarious Legislation.  //Dr. Jones would later return to the University of Eyesland to claim the Heinrich Stafford Chair of Arrangement.//

//A noted expert in politics, Dr. Jones was chosen to preside over the Butterfly Effect Advisory Committee for the Disarrangement Act in AS 989.//
