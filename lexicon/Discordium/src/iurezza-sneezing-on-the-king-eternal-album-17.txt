As an aside, I am grateful to be working with such scholars as we have on the Butterfly Effect Advisory Committee. It takes a world-class mind to make the astute observation that our resident memetosociologist practices memetosociology. I look forward to further groundbreaking discoveries linking professors of miscellania and the habit of categorizing things, or the stunning connection between studying entropology and being an asshole.
