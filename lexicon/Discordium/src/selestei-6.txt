The Selesteines' indomitable spirit and inability to back down from a challenge has gotten them burned before, particularly by some of the craftier nations (I won't name names).  For example, the [[Roerbach Incident|The Roerbach Incident]] left the entire Selesteine military abroad on a dragon-hunting quest.  I asked King Daggert off the record how he would deal with a modern attempt to trick his military out of position while an invasion tried to take his country.  He just laughed.  "Pity the invaders," he said.  "They would have to face our women."

I confess I'm not familiar with enough military lore to evaluate his strategy, but you certainly can't fault his confidence.
