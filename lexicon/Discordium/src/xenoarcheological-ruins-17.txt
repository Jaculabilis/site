//Thunder Bumble// does a run through the Vulterstrom every so often, since just because we're not the shiniest zeppelin in the Ulgravian fleet doesn't mean we can't kick a little windstorm's ass here and there.  Kain, you might be interested to know that [[Yasser's Yells]] runs a "Pentad Special" where you fly right above the Vulterbase.  It's a discounted ride because a lot of people fall off in the storm, but I think you'd be fine.
