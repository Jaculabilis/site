# Title: Captain Jango "Space" Gunnerson

**Captain Jango "Space" Gunnerson** is an archeologist, astronaut, and military veteran.  He is known for his outspoken opposition to [[Klaus Santanna]] and for being the first Kingslander to voluntarily reach space.

Captain Gunnerson is widely known in connection with his work on the [[Ultimate Dragonopolis]].  A self-described xenoenthusiast and expert in [[Vulterbase|xenoarcheological ruins]] research, Gunnerson has published multiple papers arguing that the space ship that brought the ruins' creators to this planet must still be in in orbit.  In these papers, Gunnerson has advanced multiple independent arguments with varying degrees of factual support.  One paper argues that whoever built the ruins obviously lived in them, so as long as they travelled here, whatever method of transport they used to get here must still be here.  Another paper badly mangles atmospheric physics to allegedly "prove" evidence of alien vessels breaching the atmosphere.  Tales of the Dragonopolis go back many years, of course, but most scholars consider them mythical.  The general academic consensus is that Gunnerson's arguments are based more in wish fulfillment than credible scientific research.

With such a consensus, Gunnerson shockingly did not receive any grant money from [[Iurezzan|Iurezza (continent)]] universities to fund a spacefaring expedition to locate the Ultimate Dragonopolis.  This did not deter him, however, and he appealed across the water to the National University of [[Shaster]], whose culture is better suited to scientific inquiry of such calibre.  At last, a ship was assembled and Gunnerson earned his name.

Gunnerson's expedition took everyone by surprise, not only because he survived, but because he returned with measurement data that would actually seem to vindicate his theory that the ship is still out there.  Radar has been less than fruitful in trying to detect the ship, which Gunnerson and his allies explain away by arguing that a good spaceship would absorb all forms of radiation.  What Gunnerson did instead was look for gravitational anomalies.  Fortunately for him, he discovered one floating in the shadow of [[Zor Olo]].  Opponents of his research argue that the readings might also indicate an [[ominous fixed-point cube|ominous fixed-point cubes]], or perhaps [[The Lunchtime Fallacy]] lurking aboard the //Rainbow's Teeth// as they plot their next guerrilla show.

Gunnerson's objective for the Dragonopolis is rather straight-forward: he intends to board it, arm its weapon systems, and then wipe [[Bipolaris|The Double-North Pole]] off the map.  This has caused some tension between the Compass Republic and Shaster, given that the latter funded the first expedition.  The fact that the tension has yet to escalate either indicates that Shaster's diplomats are doing their job well, or that Santanna thinks planetary bombardment by an advanced alien vessel is nothing to worry about.
