# Title: Barcuvian antiweather

One reason to think that the Esoteric Order of Florists does have a base in the Barcu region is that the sociophysical effects of the Order's activities would be noticeable anywhere else, but would fade unnoticed into the noise of Barcu's peculiar idea of what physics is. [[The Book of Schemes]] even suggests, in some translations and interpretations, that [[Flandre]] should carry out its cutting-edge experimental work in physics close to Barcu, in order to disguise the effects of the experiments. Though, of course, since we don't really know what the Order //does//, we can't tell what sort of noise they're trying to blend in.
