In //Anno Ecclesiae Superregum// 989, the Hegemony of Whales put forth the **Disarrangement Act**, a proposal to rearrange the world in order to reduce war and promote greater harmony between nations.  To ensure the highest quality of deliberation and due diligence, a number of investigative committees were established to present the relevant facts to the Assembly.

Our committee, the Butterfly Effect Advisory Committee, is tasked with investigating the possibilities that no one would otherwise think of.  As such, it may not immediately be obvious why some content has been included in this report.  Let me assure you, as the head of this Committee, that my colleagues have done fine work, and that we have curated only the most pressing information for the Assembly.  In the pages that follow, you will find reports of the highest scholarly caliber, concluded by each scholar's recommendations for the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns.  May you find this report helpful as you bring your copious wisdom to bear on the task at hand!

The Butterfly Effect Advisory Committee is:

• Chairman, **Dr. Herbert Jones** //(University of Eyesland, PhD Miscellania)//\\
• **Cincinatta Rubric** //(National Correspondence University of Incendia, MsD Misosophy)//\\
• **Dr. Gwen Hanson** //(Transient University of Ulgrav, PhD Entropology)//\\
• **M. Hon. Pierce Milton** //(Unaffiliated, MHO Memetosociology)//\\
• **Dr. Remilion Christophy** //(Unaffiliated, PhD Physics)//

The Butterfly Effect Advisory Committee would also like to recognize our former colleague **Spheven Kain** for his contributions to the Committee before the Joint University Strike Team for Interdisciplinary Collaboration Enforcement revoked his computational anthropology degree.
