# Title: High Exarch Minor Seraphi Ironheart

"The ensuing political deadlock" is a bit of an innocent way to put it. The anti-whale bloc pulled every trick in the book to impede the progress of the motion. Dr. Christophy would know, because he has enough contact with the Ironhearts to know what goes on in the coalition, and he specifically instructed the Butterfly Effect Advisory Committee he chaired to take its time preparing an exhaustive report. Yet before they were near finished, Christophy was //also// appointed to the Disarrangement Act BEAC, despite this slowing the first Committee's work to a crawl. I submitted an official complaint to have someone else take over the 988 BEAC so it wouldn't be slowed down, but nothing came of it, and the point was moot when Seraphi Ironheart was coronated. Shortly thereafter, I had an unlikely series of very unfortunate coincidences, leaving me in my current position. I can't help but feel there's a connection there, but I'm a little scared of what would happen if I looked too much into it.
