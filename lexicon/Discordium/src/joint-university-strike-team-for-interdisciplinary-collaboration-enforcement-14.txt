# Title: Joint University Strike Team for Interdisciplinary Collaboration Enforcement

Following the invention of the [[dark degrees|The Dark Pentad]] in the mid-ninth century, there was considerable tension between regular academia and dark academia. This was understandable, as the dark degrees were institutional brands of shame, and some universities even began exiling their dark academics to [[the south pole|Xenoarcheological ruins]]. Despite their professional disgrace, however, the work of dark academics was still recognized, implicitly or off the record, as containing some insights of worth, and thus a limited amount of interdisciplinary work was done between the burgeoning dark disciplines and regular academia. This work was stymied by several incidents where dark academics attempted to use the collaboration to taint the reputations of their peers.

In order to safeguard the extraction of value from the work of dark academia and protect regular academics from their erstwhile colleagues, several universities formed the Council for Interdisciplinary Collaboration in 856, which mediated interactions with dark academics in order to prevent them from taking down regular academics out of spite. This continued until 891, when the Vulterbase could not be brought to heel in the wake of the [[Goats on Boats Affair]]. Over the next few decades, the Council requested, and was approved for, an increasing amount of military power in order to bring the Vulterbase rebels to justice. By 931, the Council had become a globally-ranked military power and rebranded itself as the **Joint University Strike Team for Interdisciplinary Collaboration Enforcement**, aka JUSTICE. Turns out that your army has a nice tech advantage if it's literally made of the people who do military tech research.

In addition to power creep, the scope of the former Council's duties has also expanded beyond their original duties of keeping Pentads in line. JUSTICE also works security at research conventions, provides military defense to universities when necessary, and hunts down rogue academics who need to be eliminated. To date, very few academics have escaped their fury once roused. Sadly, as an international and interinstitutional body, they are vulnerable to bureaucracy, which is why they have yet to get permission to enter the campus of the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns to capture our own Spheven Kain. I keep giving them tips on him, but it seems he never leaves the building, so they can't grappling-hook him off the neutral ground. I'm hoping he'll slip up one of these days. If they finally get him because of me, I'll score a lot of points with them, which I need because they aren't exactly fans of my work. I guess I'm not making a lot of friends by writing papers in defense of oppressive autocrats, but what else am I supposed to use tenure for? Writing about the same "unpopular" topics everyone else is writing about to show off how progressive and daring they are? Bullshit. If tenure isn't the only thing between you and a JUSTICE tribunal, you're wasting your career.
