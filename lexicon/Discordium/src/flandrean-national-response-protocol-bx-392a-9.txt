# Title: Flandrean National Response Protocol BX-392a

[[Flandre's|Flandre]] massive body of National Response Protocols are organized by topic, with the "X Protocols" defining responses to existential threats. BX protocols specifically address existential threats of a biological nature, like [[Vigotskian|The Contagious Republic of Paul Vigotski]] invasions or the whales of [[the Hegemony|The Hegemony of Whales]] growing legs. Given Buddy "Literally Made of Snakes" Johnson's otherworldly abilities, one may wonder why the Inordinate Number of Snakes Protocol is designated under BX, rather than the fringe NRP designation SX for supernatural existential threats.

The answer is the same as to why Flandre has the National Response Protocols in the first place. Flandreans live within a constant tension between the sanctity of the unrealized future and the certainty of the determined present, and planning for every conceivable contingency is how this is reconciled. The category of the supernatural, however, is the category of that which cannot be anticipated or accounted for, and therefore the Methodocracy is incentivized to keep this category as empty as possible. I'm sure that living near Kingsland also does its fair share of shifting what one considers "natural".
