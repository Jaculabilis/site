It's worth noting that most of the ships that Selestei hijacked in Shaster were [[Panarkian|The Panark Fleet]] vessels. This would prove to be one of the formative moments for the young country, forcing them to band closer together for mutual aid to prevent a catastrophe of the same magnitude from reoccurring. Even today, the aftereffects of the War are visible in the chilly bilateral relations between the Fleet and Selestei.
