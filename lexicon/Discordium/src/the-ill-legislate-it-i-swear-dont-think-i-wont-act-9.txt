# Title: The I'll Legislate It, I Swear, Don't Think I Won't Act

[[The Hegemony of Whales]], as expected, blamed the passage of the Act on [[Flandre]], but the charge isn't entirely groundless. Flandre, after all, was at the very end of the voting order, just after Lepazzia. As each sovereign abstained from the vote, there was a growing sense that if Lepazzia didn't break their streak to abstain with every other sovereign, there wouldn't be any votes left to stop them. Yet the sovereigns right before Lepazzia, on whom the pressure increasingly mounted, were all countries that had put too much into the Act, and one by one they abstained in the hope that either Lepazzia would do something sensible or Flandre, always prepared, would stop them. When Lepazzia casually voted for the Act as if it were any other motion, all breath stopped and all eyes turned to High Exarch Ironheart. Ironheart rose slowly, looked around the room, and abstained.

The room was silent for only a moment before turning into an outright riot, with half the room charging the High Exarch and the other half fighting among themselves. The High Exarch, of course, immediately disappeared into the escape tunnel beneath his seat. The Secretary attempted to restore order, but one of the stipulations of the Act, courtesy of [[the Careless Continent]], prohibited the Secretary from stopping fights in the Assembly for the first week after its passage.
