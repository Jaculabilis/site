I don't mean to besmirch your ostensibly excellent scholarship, but I seem to recall that you waited in ambush for the Secretary to use the [[coffee machine|Omega Point Coffee Secretor]], then browbeat her until she said she liked your friend's business.  I also seem to recall the exact wording of her "recommendation" was "Fine, if it'll make you go away, yes!  I like it!"
