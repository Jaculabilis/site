I understand, with all the hard work you've been doing on the Butterfly Effect Advisory Committee report, it's difficult to find spare time. But perhaps we could discuss this while we meet regarding my recommendation for the Disputatious Assembly as to whether to pass the Disarrangement Act. I'm sure you would have some valuable insight to offer on the subject.
