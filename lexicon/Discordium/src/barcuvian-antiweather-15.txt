Rubric, you know damn well that you're the only one seriously peddling the "Sornhandr is a bunch of identical decrepit old guys pretending to be the same person throughout the ages" theory.  It pisses me off that you got four interns killed off investigating that theory.  //Four!//  I've been at this //twice// as long, put in //four// times as much work, and I've only gotten two interns!  This is so fucking unfair.
