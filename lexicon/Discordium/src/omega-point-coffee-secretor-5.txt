# Title: Omega Point Coffee Secretor

Sadly, though the Omega Point Coffee Secretor seems to be able to do anything, the terrible user interface has so far stymied Kain's efforts to find out how to have it make him a shower &mdash; or so I assume is the reason he smells like he sleeps in the janitorial closet.

Wait, wasn't he fired? Why do I keep seeing him in the office?
