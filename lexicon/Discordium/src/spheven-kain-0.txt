//**Spheven Kain** is a former computational anthropologist and current night janitor at the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns. He previously served as a member of the Butterfly Effect Advisory Committee before an unlikely series of what he maintains are coincidences that led to his departure from the Committee and the revocation of his degree. He got his revenge, though, because he used the last of his contacts to get the night janitor gig, and the President of the Committee doesn't lock up the report documents overnight. What do you think of //that//, you cretins! Thought you could get rid of me that easily?//

//In the copious amount of spare time he has since his dismissal, Kain has devoted himself to learning new skills, like lockpicking, cryptography, and free climbing. He believes strongly in the benefits of interdisciplinary collaboration, and attests that what he insists is his extended sabbatical has produced several fruitful avenues of computational anthropology research, which he plans to pursue as soon as they give him his degree back. He lives in the janitorial closet of the Disputatious Assembly's committee wing, where he is engaged in an ongoing territorial conflict with the sovereign of Incendia, who lives in the BEA Committee break room.//
