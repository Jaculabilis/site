# Title: Professor Hazard McKinley

Listen up, you motherfucker, here's the //actual// reason people don't like McKinley.  It's because&mdash;say it with me, kids&mdash;//everything goes to shit//.  You used to be able to have a decent conversation about the way all the studies on e.g. [[Ulgravian|The Ulgravian Diaspora]] airship pollution come out of the [[National Academy of Velskyavo]] and the money trail disappears into the [[fucking ocean|The Hegemony of Whales]].  But the fucking hippies got fed up when people didn't swallow their so-called "evidence," so they turn to charismatic arsonists like McKinley who say "Instead of //reading// the studies, roll them up like a fucking newspaper and beat your opponents with them!"  There's a fucking reason //Bludgeoning with Facts// was only printed in hardcover.  Some editions don't even have words!

News flash!  //He's not a real professor!//  Why the fuck would you trust him with scholarship?
