If such a thing ever happened, I'm sure I've never heard of it.  But sometimes people have accidents, and it's not unheard-of for tourists like, say, yourself to wear parachutes just in case.  Just be warned that bulky items like that increase your chances of slipping off.  I could maybe introduce you to my friend Yasser, but it's so hard to schedule the time these days.  I'm sure I'll get to it eventually.
