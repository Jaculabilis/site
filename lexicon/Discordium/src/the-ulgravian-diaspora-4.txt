# Title: The Ulgravian Diaspora

The nation of Ulgrav holds the distinction of sharing a border with every country on the planet, as the country's territory is technically the entire atmosphere.  They say of themselves that they took to the sky to embrace the flame of adventure, but scholarly consensus is that they were actually just [[fleeing the passive-aggression of neighboring Lepazzia|Lepazzia]].  (If possible, don't let Dr. Hanson see this.)

Ulgrav's role in contemporary geopolitics is a somewhat precarious one.  The sky has precious few resources beyond sunlight, water vapor, and the occasional bird.  Consequently, Ulgrav is entirely dependent upon their trade allies (primarily [[Flandre]] and [[the Compass Republic|The Double-North Pole]]) for essentials like oil and raw materials.  At the same time, their control of airspace is nearly absolute.  The last country to challenge them directly was the Theocracy of Rime in AES 947, and nearly fifty years later they're still a collection of subsistence farmers after [[what the Ulgravians did to them|The Night of Storms]].  So of course no country //really// feels safe when zeppelins are in their airspace, but no one wants to make a fuss of it either.

The unique situation of the Ulgravian Diaspora has also put them in a complicated position with respect to the Disarrangement Act.  Years of being cramped up on zeppelins and feeling like their homeland was taken from them has pushed the diaspora's general mood into bitterness and resentment.  Indeed, in meetings of the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns, the Ulgravian Sovereign can't help but let some of that bitterness slip inner his own manner.  So Ulgrav desperately wants the Act to pass so that they can get, in the words of my esteemed colleague Dr. Hanson, "some fucking land."  At the same time, the continued existence of their zeppelin fleet depends on oil trade with Flandre, which is highly motivated to prevent the Act from passing.  Even a brief review of the historical record will suffice to communicate that Flandre is, bar none, the worst country on the planet to double-cross.  Thus, Ulgrav has wisely chosen to speak against the Act for the time being.

Culturally, the Ulgravians are of course known for their barely repressed rage, but they also possess strong communal values.  This is likely a result of selection pressures, as anyone found guilty of egregious acts against the community is typically thrown off the airship.  Cultural critics sometimes observe that this practice is similar to their recreational activity called [[windstriding|Windstriding]], wherein someone is thrown off the airship, except with a rope tied around them.  These critics typically suggest that both customs reflect their deep-seated need to escape their exile and return to their homeland.  However, as a memetosociologist, I would note that these critics are usually Ulgravians, and this analysis just serves to reinforce the country's standard propaganda line.  I would further note that there is really not that much to do onboard an airship, and they are probably all just bored.
