Ah, Mr. Kain, I'm quite pleased that you found the time to put this together, what with how busy you've been clearing out your office over the past two years.  (Speaking of which, I was pleasantly surprised to see your very clean office this morning.  Though the loss of your academic career was tragic, I've always felt your work as a night janitor has been exceptional.)  Now, I know you've had your qualifications revoked, but I do think this is good scholarship, so I'll see if I can get it into the final report.  Enjoy your trip with Dr. Hanson!
