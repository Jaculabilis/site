It's interesting to note that High Exarch Minor Ironheart, in convincing the Killer Bus of Kingsland North to assist her, was following a minor Flandrean command narrative.  In Flandrean culture, when all else has failed and you are beset by troubles your plans can't overcome, you head north and hope to find something more terrible than whatever problem you're facing&mdash;an approach also taken by [[St. Stafford|High Illuminator Saint Doctor Heinrich Stafford]] before constructing the [[Zeitgeist Manipulator]].  It's understood that this course of action is extremely high-risk, but it goes hand in hand with another piece of Flandrean wisdom, which is that sometimes a solvable crisis is better than an unsolvable inconvenience.
