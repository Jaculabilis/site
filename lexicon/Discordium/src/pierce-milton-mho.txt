# Title: ~Pierce Milton, MHO

//Introductory memetosociology texts will tell you that memetosociologists study the ways in which society's perception of how society works influences the way society actually works.  But **Pierce Milton, MHO** is one of the few memetosociologists who will tell you that those textbooks are themselves a memetosociological pressure vector that try to shape the way young m-socists try to pursue their discipline.//

//In AS 983, Honored Milton won acclaim by uncovering the secret insider-only fast-track inside the m-soc program at Stafford College and blackmailing the administration into giving him his degree after only three weeks.  Over the next three months, he successfully negotiated Masters degrees from Kains University and the Royal University of Lepazzia simultaneously, before following up with a PhD from Warbaum's University before the end of the year.  This rise in prominence beat the fastest record for m-soc career path completion, so by the following year the Grand Council of Memetosociologists had awarded him the right to use the honorific above PhD: MHO, or "Most Honored One."//

//In recognition of his academic and social engineering achievements, Honored Milton invited himself to the Butterfly Effect Advisory Committee and joined in AS 987.//
