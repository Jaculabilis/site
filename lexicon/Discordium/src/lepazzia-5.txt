Lepazzia keeps something of a low profile in the international community, but it's important to remember their ostensible neutrality doesn't translate to a neutral impact on global politics.  For example, if the Lepazzian Sovereign had truly wanted to agree with the other Sovereigns, he would have also abstained on the [[I'll Legislate It Act|The I'll Legislate It, I Swear, Don't Think I Won't Act]] instead of voting in favor.  And the [[Massively Parallel Peace Conference]] illustrates, perhaps a little more clearly, that Lepazzia has it out for all of us.  It might be wise to look past the cultural differences between us and realize that they probably consider themselves, in their own way, to be at war with everyone else.
