# Title: The Panark Fleet

Another reason that [[the Hegemony of Whales]] isn't too keen to press its case against the Panark Fleet by force is that the Fleet essentially controls the [[Taurus Research Station]]. When every space-capable country and Kingsland attached their own thrusters to the station, there was no rhyme or reason to where the thrusters were placed. Now turning the Taurus in any direction requires calculations too complicated for anybody but the Fleet to compute, by virtue of their unmatched computational resources. Nominally, the Fleet does the math for the Assembly as a due, but whenever other sovereigns make fun of Panark for having "fake land", they always change the topic to the Taurus, and eventually the others caught their drift.
