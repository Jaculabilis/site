# Title: Symphonic warp traversal

This shit always gets me going.  Do you know where they got that idea?  From [[Ulgrav|The Ulgravian Diaspora]].  There's a paper from one of our researchers a year or two before the VDIS experiments where the author (don't remember the name, fuck i'm drunk) suggests trying different genres of music to see what happens.  Up comes this fucker from [[Velskyavo|National Academy of Velskyavo]], who walks into, into, fuck.  Whatever.  Walks into the researcher's lab and says "Hey dude"—wait, Jameson, that was the guy's name—says "Hey Jameson, you working on anything cool?"  Jameson says "Fuck yeah, dude, wanna see?"  Velsky fucker says "Totally, dude," then shoots him and all of his lab assistants and walks off with all his shit.  So now the history books say that warp travel came out of the VDIS, which is completely missing the fuckign point.

You know why Ulgrav was researching warp travel?  Because we //need some fucking land//, and we're desperate enough that we'll take it on other planets if we have to.
