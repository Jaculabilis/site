Though the squid-trees have rendered the Vulterbase inaccessible, [[the Panark Fleet]] still checks in on it from afar every now and then, since the Vulterstrom makes it invisible to the [[Taurus|Taurus Research Station]]. On the night of the new moon, an eldritch green light can be seen shining from where the base is in the depths of the storm. The main hypothesis for this is that the rebels assembled something, either from leftover technology they had lying around, alien miscellanea scavenged from the ruins, or something they dredged up from a ship that sank trying to suppress them. Most think it's an energy reactor of some sort, since they wouldn't survive long without one, but nobody can explain what kind of reactor would produce that light. Moreover, the light is only faint at the long distance Panark observes from; at the base itself it must be incredibly bright. Less popular is the theory that it's a lighthouse of some sort. This theory is less popular because nobody //really// thinks the Vulterbase rebels care enough about the rest of the world to stop their ships from running aground. They'd probably welcome it, because they could scavenge the parts. There's also a fringe theorist who keeps ranting about "[[chromatic aberration]] this" and "sociophysical effects that", but Dr. Christophy gets annoyed when you call him a fringe theorist.
