# Title: Hard light projection

The controversy over hard light //projection// is related to, but ought not be confused with, the lesser-known controversy over hard light //projectors//. While the former was an academic venture of international proportions, the latter was a dispute that occurred between the Left Physics Department and the Right Physics Department of Kera University. The former produced a prototype hard light projector with a user interface so arcane that it was nigh-impossible to use, and offered this as a contribution to the debate over what could be considered hard light projection. The latter objected, claiming that neither the projection nor the light was hard, and drove its point home by creating a slide projector out of titanium and bashing the Left Physics Department's prototype to pieces. This resulted, as is typical at Kera University, in a semester-long campaign of vengeance.
