# Title: Flandre

The most hilarious thing about Flandre is their relationship to [[Selestei]].  The two countries are supposed to be allies.  Everyone over in Selestei loves Flandre, despite the fact that from a Selesteine point of view Flandrean culture is essentially institutionalized cowardice.  Meanwhile, Flandre appears to take every possible opportunity to fuck Selestei over.  But no matter how hard they try, Selestei somehow manages to avoid the vast majority of the negative consequences.  Not only that, but they don't even seem to have noticed this has been going on.  You should have seen [[Ironheart|High Exarch Minor Seraphi Ironheart]]'s eye twitching when Daggert gave her a bear hug last week, it was the most //hilarious// shit.
