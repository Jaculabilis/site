Very fine work, M. Hon. Milton.  I think in the final draft you should consider mentioning the Mapmakers' role in the [[Roerbach Incident|The Roerbach Incident]], given that we wouldn't have seen such tremendous uproar in the Assembly if not for the fake maps.  But please don't take that suggestion as a criticism of your excellent scholarship here.
