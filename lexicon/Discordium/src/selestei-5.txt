Yelling at the sun is an ancient and venerable tradition in Selestei, but it acquired a tint of patriotism when the country entered the Disputatious Assembly and was asked to register an official national anthem. Thus, at occasions when the national anthem of a sovereign's country is played, when the King of Selestei's turn comes, a band of Selesteines come out and scream into the heavens. This is very popular with crowds, whom the King encourages to join in.
