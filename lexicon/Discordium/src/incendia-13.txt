# Title: Incendia

For a country with an inordinate number of fire-based cultural traditions, Incendia ran a very tight ship as a safety and storage guarantor. All sorts of historical documents were stored in the Incendian vaults, including the original copies of the [[Ulgravian|The Ulgravian Diaspora]] land lease documents. This, of course, came to an end with the 974 collapse. Incendia's remaining [[mad lawyer|Mad legal practice]], Parvus the Litigator, attempted to use this to have the land lease contract nullified in order to ward off any future Ulgravian retribution. After a hurried consultation by President Niir, Parvus mad-lawed himself into being the defense lawyer and began arguing the official Incendian position that the homeland had not been destroyed, and therefore there was no breach of the contract. This resulted in a schizophrenic trial in which Parvus viciously argued at length with himself in front of a confused judge. When he began to lose the defending case, he resorted to personal attacks against the plaintiff (i.e. himself), until the trial degenerated into a fistfight in which he put himself in a headlock and choked himself out. The judge, unsure of what had just happened, threw the case out. This may have been the Litigator's plan all along, however, because the Assembly courts are now turned off from touching anything related to the legal status of Incendia.
