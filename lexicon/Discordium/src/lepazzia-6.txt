In a way, we have Lepazzia to thank for inspiring the Disarrangement Act. When their cultural passive-aggression had reached new heights in the fourth century, they literally drew a line in the sand and dug a massive trench around their entire country to make a point to their neighbors on [[the Careless Continent]]. While most geologists are confused as to how merely digging a trench could result, as it did, in Lepazzia drifting off into the ocean, in my opinion as a sociophysicist, this is no mystery at all. Lepazzian culture is nothing if not one that keeps others at arms' length. The Lepazzian Split was simply the physical manifestation of the social phenomenon in accordance with the principles of sociophysics.
