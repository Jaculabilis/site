Long revered for its eerie beauty, historical significance and association with magic, **Zor Olo** is the third and smallest moon.  But you don't care about that.  You're reading this article to find out why there's a giant fucking smiley face in the night sky, leering at you and scaring the snotty little bipedal consumerism batteries you call children.

First off, [[researchers|Captain Jango "Space" Gunnerson]] are pretty sure that the moon didn't start out that way.  (Like, duh, it's a fucking ball of rock.  Smiley faces aren't natural fucking phenomena.)  The historical record puts it as one of the main inciting events for the [[Roerbach Incident|The Roerbach Incident]].  So really the big puzzle is how it got that way.  How'd someone fuck up a moon eight hundred years before anyone made it to space?

Well, there's an easy answer and a hard answer.  The easy answer is we don't really know //how// it was done, so we probably don't have to worry about the same thing happening to one of the other moons, or to the planet.  Besides, it's been a long time, so we're probably done with that sort of thing happening again, right?  Yeah, well, //easy answers are for cowards//.

The hard answer is that we do know //why// it happened: fucking [[Kingsland|Pantheons of Kingsland]].  ("We" here excludes the whole lot of [[tumor-brained sea cows|The Hegemony of Whales]] who blame [[Flandre]].)  Shoulda been obvious in hindsight, really.  Like, their whole fucking shtick is "oh no, the stars are right, we're all doomed!"  And I get that y'all wanna just laugh the whole thing off, cuz when has an ancient Kingslander deity every shown up and fucked up //your// front lawn?  

Well, it happened.  Apparently some kinda eldritch thingy showed up and they managed to seal it in the moon.  That's what caused the giant smily cracks.  It also [[fucked up the ocean|Missing Sea]] despite the fact that [[tides don't work that way|Barcuvian antiweather]].

So here's the thingâ€”your dismissive, I-don't-wanna-worry-about-this-because-it-distract-me-from-watching-television attitude is //ridiculously// stupid, because every night the tentacle-prints of some unspeakable horror play voyeur on your pathetic excuse for a sex life.  Just in case you weren't paying attention, we've got ancient Kingslander records saying the holes in the third moon happened because //the stars were right for once//.  Like, you wanna talk about butterfly effects?  What do you do when the butterfly is some eleventh-dimensional thing that can't eat us because the continents happen to be aligned in the right way?  //What the fuck do you think happens when you move them around//?
