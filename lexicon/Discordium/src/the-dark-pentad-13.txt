# Title: The Dark Pentad

Being the academic equivalent of a leper can be trying at times, but it does have its benefits. Just as nobody wants to share a room with a leper, for example, no regular academic wants to share an office with a Pentad. So, if you're a Pentad who wants an office, all you really have to do is walk into someone's office and start working there, and they'll quickly make themselves scarce to avoid any association with you. I work at a correspondence university, so we don't even own any buildings &mdash; yeah, yeah, the main campus still exists in the [[Incendian|Incendia]] homeland, stuff it &mdash; and yet I've never been lacking for an office, even when I'm only visiting another university for the weekend. I was the //de facto// chair of a department for a week just because I hijacked the former chair's office and started using his official stamp for fun.
