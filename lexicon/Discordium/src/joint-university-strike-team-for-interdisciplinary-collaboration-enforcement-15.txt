# Title: Joint University Strike Team for Interdisciplinary Collaboration Enforcement

The suits over at JUSTICE "aren't exactly fans of [Rubric's] work" because the last time [[someone|Queen Beneficent the Plenitudinous]] put her ideas into practice, every university in the country was emptied and replaced with propaganda offices. Why hasn't JUSTICE been after her for years already? Sure, she lives and works in Kingsland, so it's understandable why nobody wants to go after her there. But she commutes to the DAS campus for Butterfly Effect Advisory meetings, doesn't she? How many countries does she have to indirectly destroy before someone wises up and puts her on a wanted list?

Well, I'm not just going to sit around and wait for it. You should really invest in a better lock for that secret drawer in your desk, Cincinatta. I've read your notes about having the [[Taurus|Taurus Research Station]] capture the [[Zeitgeist Manipulator]] from orbit so you can reprogram it to make everyone agree with your ideas. Real clever, how you plan to circumvent the psychological barriers to stopping it that the Manipulator creates. Not so clever leaving the plan where I could find it. I wonder what JUSTICE will think of your little conspiracy when I fax it to them?
