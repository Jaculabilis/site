# Title: The Killer Bus of Kingsland North

I've done some reading about the Killer Bus, and it's harrowing stuff.  After the first incident, they removed it from the transit system.  The next morning, there was an extra bus at the transit station and no one could figure out which one it was.  After the next incident, they wrote down the serial number for each bus and then removed it again.  Overnight, there was a different list of serial numbers in the handwriting of the manager who had originally written it, and the bus count was up by one again.  They tried adding more measures the third time—cameras, locking the gate, caltrops on the road—but in the morning, the gate's technical log reported it was closed the whole evening, the caltrops were arranged into sanity-melting glyphs, and everyone who reviewed the camera feed instantly went mad.

And this time, the extra bus was parked... //right... in... front... of the manager's office!//

Chilling stuff! I told that story to my grandchildren the other week, both because they're adorable when they're scared, and also because it's never to early to learn to fear Kingsland.
