# Title: The Killer Bus of Kingsland North

In my personal opinion, the mayor should stop being such a sissy and move back. My neighbors got eaten by something last summer and the flat's been vacant long enough that I'm sure whatever did it has moved on. It's the least sacrifice he could make for his country. Over here in Kingsland South, we'd kill to get that many Assembly votes, and I can't imagine how the Northerners would feel to have the Killer Bus off the streets.
