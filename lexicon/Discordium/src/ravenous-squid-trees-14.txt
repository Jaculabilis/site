# Title: Ravenous Squid-Trees

There's quite a story behind the giant squid-tree that downed the //Whisper-on-the-grass//.  Its discovery caused no small degree of horror from the international community, both on account of its existence and because of the implication that similar things could exist elsewhere in the ocean—and would, quite necessarily, occur in the last place you'd look.  //El Fauces del Diablo//, or "the Jaws of the Devil," as the giant-squid-tree quickly became known, spurred unprecedented international collaboration on a global perception system (GPS).  //El Fauces// itself merited a dedicated geosynchronous satellite for the specific purpose of ensuring the monster did not grow any larger, or else legs or wings or something equally horrifying.  There was even talk of turning [[Taurus Research Station]] on the monstrous vegetation, but the Hegemony quickly put an end to that line of discussion by threatening to capsize whatever nation voted in favor—not their fleet, mind you, the actual //nation//.  Though //El Fauces// survives to this day, there is an ongoing research project to study the [[Missing Sea]] in hopes of separating //El Fauces del Diablo// from the rest of the ocean.
