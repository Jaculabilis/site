# Title: Mad legal practice

A connection I would emphasize between the development of quantum mechanics and the invention of mad law is that mad law //predates// quantum theory. As a sociophysicist, I can't help but see a causal connection here. Would it be so far beyond the pale to suggest that quantum mechanics was not developed before mad law because quantum systems did not //exist// before mad law? Would it be that crazy to suggest that the indeterminacy of the laws of humanity is what gave rise to the indeterminacy of the laws of nature?

Dr. Rubric is telling me that it would be, and she's brandishing her mug rather menacingly, so I must conclude that this requires more thought at another time.
