I've got a personal theory about where the snakes came from.

Friend in Kingsland told me there's a legend of an ancient cult that got foiled by Flandrean National Response Protocols one too many times, so they cursed Flandre to have to deal with a nest of snakes for every time they foiled someone's plot.  'Course, "a wizard did it" isn't all that scholarly of an explanation, so maybe that cult went off and bred snakes like mad for the next thousand years or so.  Either way.
