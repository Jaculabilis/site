Ah, Mr. Kain, I'm quite pleased that you found the time to put this together, what with how busy you've been clearing out your office over the past two years.  (I do hope that's going well, by the way.  Strictly speaking, you should have been out of here by late 990.  Let me know if I can do anything to help speed things along.)  Now, I know you've had your qualifications revoked, but I do think this is good scholarship, so I'll see if I can get it into the final report.  Enjoy your trip with Dr. Hanson!
