The 933-934 rules dispute had some longer-lasting effects. One vendor in the 934 season rolled a bunch of meat into a ball, baked it in a pastry shell, and sold it as a "Selsroll". The timing was perfect and it became a hit with horseball fans. This was all well and good until an internal memo of the IHC was leaked, revealing ongoing discussions to host a horseball tournament in which the losing team's horses would be ground up and made into selsrolls to be enjoyed by the winning team and their fans. This dealt a severe blow both to the IHC's credibility and selsroll vendors, both of which took years to recover.
