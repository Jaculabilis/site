Incendia was //supposed// to be safeguarding our land until we wanted it back.  It's right there in the fucking lease agreements.  But noooooo, the fuckers just //had// to go and set the whole damn thing on fire.  Niir should have been kicked out of the assembly, and then he should have been tossed right back into the bonfire he made of our land.  Fucking Sovereign went all soft on him.  

Anyways, this is why I regularly "accidentally" spill my coffee on the fucker when he's sleeping in our break room.
