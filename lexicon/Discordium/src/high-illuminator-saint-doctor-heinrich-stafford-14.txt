# Title: High Illuminator Saint Doctor Heinrich Stafford

Historians have said that is impossible to overestimate the legacy of **Dr. Heinrich Stafford**.  Few historical figures have so many achievements to their name or are spoken of with such praise, though of course they lack the distinction of [[having those opinions broadcast worldwide|Zeitgeist Manipulator]].  Devices designed by the illustrious Dr. Stafford can be found at the root of most modern technological innovations, and it seems the man could not order a sandwich without founding a revolutionary academic discipline.  I exaggerate, but not by much: my own field, miscellania, was created after Dr. Stafford rearranged his office file cabinet in AES 923.

Born in AES 888—an auspicious year in his native Flandre—the future internationally-acclaimed genius quickly demonstrated himself to be in an intellectual class above his peers and even his instructors.  In the sometimes cutthroat environment of Flandrean academics, this put something of a target on the young Stafford.  However, the pressure from his would-be peers desisted after he tricked three students and a professor into their respective booby traps.  The academic credentials of the professor, one Dr. Sandra Anderson, were automatically bequeathed to Stafford in accordance with the then-recently passed Petard Forfeiture Laws.  This resulted in him taking a professorship at the age of 17, shortly afterward publishing his first paper on the [[electric undead]] in AES 905.

Dr. Stafford's subsequent accomplishments are, of course, a matter of historical record.  Particularly noteworthy are his invention of [[asynchronous energy theory|Asynchronous energy]] in AES 908; solving the location of every [[fixed-point cube|Ominous fixed-point cubes]] in AES 911; adapting the rules of [[Horseball]] in AES 920; and the invention of [[computational theology|Assemblies of Gods]] in AES 923, for which he was sainted, in addition to receiving the unique distinction of "High Illuminator," a title meant to reflect his status as the highest bringer of knowledge to our humble species.  I shan't spend much time on these topics here, as as they have been extensively covered in my colleagues' excellent articles about them.  I will note, however, that you will find much of Dr. Stafford's work was ultimately accomplished by other people, as the man himself was too busy inventing other revolutionary ideas to build a proof of concept for his earlier revolutionary ideas.

A celebrated public figure and undoubtedly a man who single-handedly changed humanity's course through the heavens, Dr. Stafford left us one winter eve in AES 939.  According to the official reports&mdash;which, it must be said, are Flandrean government documents, so take this with as much salt as you like&mdash;Dr. Stafford had been researching the [[Missing Sea]] to uncover metaphysical secrets of the universe.  His hope was reportedly to transcend to a higher plane of being, a hope which is not all that far-fetched when you consider the [[sorts|The Killer Bus of Kingsland North]] of [[things|Buddy "Literally Made of Snakes" Johnson]] which may be found in Kingsland.  Whatever device he may have constructed has never been found; however, it is incontrovertible that Dr. Stafford was never seen again.  Still, there are many&mdash;myself included&mdash;who like to keep a picture of him on our desks, and whisper a little prayer every time we submit a paper for publication.  Just in case.
