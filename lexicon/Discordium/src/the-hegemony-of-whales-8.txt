# Title: The Hegemony of Whales

I've got a sneaking suspicion that if the Disarrangement Act passes, the Hegemony might just strand every country alone in the water.  All they have to do is offer [[Flandre]]'s oil fields to [[Ulgrav|The Ulgravian Diaspora]].  If they do that, then between the zeppelin fleet and the Whale Tariffs both nations could corner all global trade.
