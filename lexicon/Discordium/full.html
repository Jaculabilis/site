<div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>986 Bring Your Daughter to Work Day incident</h2><p><i>This entry hasn't been written yet.</i></p></div><p></p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>Assemblies of Gods</h2><p>The field of computational theology was founded by <u>High Illuminator Dr. Heinrich Stafford</u><sup>1</sup> in an offhand comment in the margin of a paper he was grading, which has become a relic since his canonization as a saint. Noting the use of ritual and repetition within religious devotion, Stafford theorized that religious ritual could be abstracted into an algorithm, which could then be implemented by any universal computer, allowing the ritual to be repeated at hardware speed over every computational core. When this marginal note was discovered, it sparked a flood of research into the algorithmic representation of ritual and the digital representation of symbol, most of which was immediately anathematized. The bulk of these anathemas were lifted in the following decades, allowing the products of its research to be aired openly. Within computational theology, a program whose execution corresponds to the performance of a particular ritual is known as a <i>divine assembly</i>, and the library of divine assemblies that have been written by computational theologians is referred to as the <b>Assemblies of Gods</b>.</p></div>
<p>The Assemblies remained a rather academic affair until the 960s, when <u>Shaster</u><sup>2</sup> was rocked by agitation from <u>misosophers and economists</u><sup>3</sup> who wanted to replace all religious activity in Shaster with divine assembly executions, thus eliminating both the philosophical quandaries of divinity and all bank holidays. The so-called "computational reformers" gained a foothold in the Senate, which allowed them to hang on to relevance for most of the decade until the  untimely death of the movement's leader, Ik Severent, in a shipwreck. His successors, Harry and Isabelle Writsmith, were incompetent to the task of defending the movement to the Senate. Within the year, the country tired of their shenanigans, and banned computational theology outright. A brief resurgence a few years later was quickly quashed when the Senate threatened to have a national university posthumously award Severent a dysthetics degree. The Senate even proposed naming computational theology as a Dark Pentad discipline, though the measure was quietly tabled after <u>the Panark Fleet</u><sup>4</sup>, a bosom ally of Shaster, expressed significant disapproval of the motion.</p>
<p>Most usage of the Assemblies of Gods is done on Panark servers, either by Panark itself or offered as a service to other countries. On most holy days, the Fleet offers complementary cycles to countries to run divine assemblies that correspond to observances for that day. This has become a point of tension with Kingsland, whose <u>complicated religious landscape</u><sup>5</sup> all but ensures that every day is a holy day for at least one Kingslander cult.</p>

Despite this, <b>antiweather</b> remains one of the biggest reasons why it's inexplicable that people still live in the geographical region of Barcu. The ultimate cause of antiweather, and its localization to Barcu, remain unknown, though one favored theory blames it on an ancient and accidental case of <u>space persuasion</u><sup>1</sup>.</p></div>
<p>The most common form of antiweather is <i>uprain</i>, which condenses into droplets deep in the water table, then precipitates up until it breaks through the ground, rising into the sky to become clouds and drenching the underpants of any visitors who forgot their underbrellas. More severe forms of antiweather include <i>antithunderstorms</i>, where bolts of darkness cause sudden periods of silence, and <i>antitornados</i>, wherein air from the upper atmosphere is blown to the surface in a column that pushes away everything near its base. The <i>crepusculum borealis</i> was previously blamed on Kingsland, until archaeologists found evidence that the shadowy curtains that occasionally flit through the region were attested from before Kingsland was founded. The snow in Barcu is hot, but it's still just called snow.</p>
<p>Geologists studying Barcu often invoke antiweather effects to explain Barcu's odd mountainous geography. While some regions of Barcu are relatively flat, like the Barrowlands, the mountainous areas rise up sharply, creating stark boundaries between jagged, rocky slopes and arcadian plains. This happens, it is thought, because while normally mountains are weathered down, in Barcu they are weathered up. The air of mystery this gives Barcuvian mountains makes it a popular location for the theorized headquarters of <u>the Esoteric Order of Florists</u><sup>2</sup> &mdash; a somewhat flawed theory, because the Order has never (been proven to have) given anyone the common Barcuvian Laserlily, and you'd think that they'd make use of such an easily-available resource if they were really based there.</p>
<p>Antiweather is thought by some to be closely related to the <u>electric undead</u><sup>3</sup>, which have been traced back to the Barrowlands. These researchers theorize that both the electric undead and antiweather are sustained by an ancestral curse lying over the Barrowlands. Some fringe theorists further suggest that the Barrowlands' current sovereign, Sornhandr, King Eternal, has been cursed to live on as a revenant, and that this is why the last few sovereigns of the Barrowlands have all had the exact same name and appearance. The mild racism of these suggestions aside, answers have not been forthcoming, since the interns tasked with asking the King Eternal about this tend to receive ancient curses in an old and forgotten tongue instead of answers, and my grad students keep quitting when I <u>suggest they try</u><sup>4</sup>. However, the ancient curses often cause their victims to be struck by lightning, so the connection is plausible.</p>

The myths included within are, of course, only a subset of all of the myths of the Flandrean people, and many various other anthologies may be found that include the so-called deuterocanonical myths. The <i>Book of Schemes</i>, however, is the product of centuries of scholarly work to create an anthology that would most fully and faithfully reflect the national consciousness of Flandre.</p></div>
<p>To this end, its contents have been carefully selected to maximize applicability over important topics of national interest using a lean subset of all Flandrean mythology. Furthering this goal, scholars have spent centuries fitting linguistic ambiguities into the official translations. As the inimitable <u>Dr. Stafford</u><sup>2</sup> observed, this creates not only a common mytho-cultural language by enculturing all Flandreans with the same set of common narratives, but also, by shaping the problems that will be encountered in interpreting the text, a common set of conceptual categories through which the great questions of human culture are approached.</p>
<p>None of this, though, so faithfully captures the Flandrean spirit as the fact that every officially-sanctioned copy of the <i>Book of Schemes</i> is booby-trapped. Despite this (or, more likely, because of this), it is a standard part of the primary school curriculum. Since the middle of the century, criticism of the use of official copies of the <i>Book of Schemes</i> has drawn comparisons to <u>X-treme lecturing</u><sup>3</sup>. The Council of Exarchs denies the comparison as libelous and inaccurate and invites any skeptics to read the "Myth of the Two Swans", specifically in the official translation. For example, the attentive reader may recognize parallels between "Flan and the Titan of the Woods" and Flandre's actions during <u>the Roerbach Incident</u><sup>4</sup>.</p>
<p>Despite its weaponization as a national resource for contingency plans, the renditions of myths in the <i>Book of Schemes</i> are still impressive literary works in their own right. Their creation myth is a grand epic relating the rise and fall of Flan, their patron deity. According to this myth, the existence of the world is the result of Flan's contingency plan in case of nonexistence, which he prepares so expertly that it executes before he is born. Extended quotations from this section of the myth were used in "Origination", the second track of Sneezing on the King Eternal's 961 album <u><i>Iurezza</i></u><sup>5</sup> to critical acclaim. Its reception was especially favorable in Flandre, where it was covered by <u>The Lunchtime Fallacy</u><sup>6</sup> at the coronation of the <u>High Exarch Minor</u><sup>7</sup> in 990. That The Lunchtime Fallacy was allowed to leave in one piece after crashing the Flandrean coronation is a testament to the enduring power of this song.</p>

Buddy Johnson is <i>literally</i> made of snakes. People sometimes get the wrong impression, because to the unaided eye he appears just like everyone else. But unlike a human, every single one of his cells is a tightly-packed snake. He needs only to sneeze to fill a room from floor to ceiling with snakes as they uncurl themselves to full size. He can hiss as loud as the <u>Selesteine national anthem</u><sup>1</sup>, and probably much louder if he tries. He can squeeze his body through any hole large enough to fit his bones, which are the only parts of him that aren't made of snakes &mdash; as far as we know.</p></div>
<p>Terrible things always come from Barcu, of course, and Johnson is no exception. But where did <i>he</i> come from, specifically? Opinions are divided. Some say that he was once a man who became snakes. Others say that he was once snakes who became a man. The former view has to its advantage that the inordinate number of snakes that make up Johnson would have been noticeable before they became him. The latter view has to its advantage that he usually appears as the sort of generic human you'd come up with if you were an alien trying to make a human disguise, and "Buddy Johnson" is pretty up there on the list of most generic names.</p>
<p>Who or whatever he was before he was Literally Made of Snakes &mdash; assuming he <i>was</i> anything before &mdash; he first appeared in Kingsland on <u>Tesseraction Eve</u><sup>2</sup> in AES 954, when all of the city's storm drains began inexplicably disgorging snakes at high pressure into the air. Some of the snake-clouds that formed drifted south to <u>Flandre</u><sup>3</sup>, but most precipitated where they formed over Kingsland. When the snake geysers dissipated and the snakes had drained into the river, Buddy Johnson climbed out, literally made of snakes. From then on, he became a fixture of Kingsland South, terrorizing the populace that lived there. Southside got a brief respite in 987, when they managed to get him elected as the mayor, forcing him to leave the city for Disputatious Assembly sessions. This was short-lived, however. After a few months, Johnson sat snakes in every free seat in the Assembly, becoming for a moment the majority vote <i>per se</i>, and then unilaterally banned himself from the Assembly. An attempted resistance by the Flandrean High Exarch Cerberus Ironheart was foiled by <u>the Hegemon of Whales</u><sup>4</sup>; Johnson would subsequently <u>invade Flandre for revenge</u><sup>5</sup>. He was finally driven out in 990 by the newly ascended <u>High Exarch Minor Seraphi Ironheart</u><sup>6</sup>, and not been seen since.</p>

<p>Friend in Kingsland told me there's a legend of an ancient cult that got foiled by Flandrean National Response Protocols one too many times, so they cursed Flandre to have to deal with a nest of snakes for every time they foiled someone's plot.  'Course, "a wizard did it" isn't all that scholarly of an explanation, so maybe that cult went off and bred snakes like mad for the next thousand years or so.  Either way.</p>

<p></p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>Captain Jango "Space" Gunnerson</h2><p><i>This entry hasn't been written yet.</i></p></div><p></p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>The Careless Continent</h2><p>There is not much point to trying to write a contemporary account of the <b>Careless Continent</b> (short for "I Couldn't Care Less What You Call It", the response of the DAS Secretary to infighting over the name from its residents), owing to the fact that its political landscape changes so rapidly that by the time you write an encyclopedia about it, some of the countries have already ceased to exist. It is, bar none, the <u>Guild of Mapmakers'</u><sup>1</sup> least favorite continent. Nor is it a surprise that <u>Lepazzia</u><sup>2</sup> picked up their entire country and left the continent behind in the fourth century &mdash; an event that didn't make the Guild any happier.</p></div>
<p>Why, exactly, the Careless Continent is in a state of constant warfare and regime change is lost to history. More specifically, so many competing histories have been promulgated by the ephemeral governments of Careless that the task of sifting through them for the nuggets of truth is herculean. Actually visiting the continent for archaeology is out of the question: to get to anything that <i>isn't</i> already collateral damage requires trekking through multiple active war zones.</p>
<p>It's not clear that the various nations of Careless even care what the reasons are. For them, instability is simply the way life is. In most of the languages of Careless, the word for "government" shares a root with the word for "temporary structure". Sovereigns rotate in and out of the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns so often that the consensus is now that Careless nations only declare themselves a state in order to send a champion as a sovereign to the Assembly to fight another nation's sovereign, because they'll be in an easy-to-find location, and anybody they sent to the Assembly must have been important. Getting used to/dodging the sparring sovereigns of Careless is something of a rite of passage for new members of the Assembly. <u>The Hegemon of Whales</u><sup>3</sup>, given the great cultural barrier between humans and whales, has still not gotten used to it, and blames <u>Flandre</u><sup>4</sup>.</p>
<p>Ever since <u>certain events six years ago</u><sup>5</sup> in the Assembly, <u>the Secretary</u><sup>6</sup> has quarantined the sovereigns of the Careless Continent in the "Time-Out Corner". Some of the other sovereigns have expressed disapproval with this measure, both at the implication that unruly sovereigns are like so many misbehaving children to Secretary Tomas, and at the consequence that the Careless sovereigns now fight even <i>more</i>, since nobody is in the way. Tomas, in response has pointed out that because they are out of the way, their fighting is quicker and less distracting.</p>

DAS Secretary Ruby Tomas</p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>The Contagious Republic of Paul Vigotski</h2><p>No one messes with the concept of nationhood like <b>Paul Vigotski</b>.  He's the only person with a seat in the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns who is not actually a Sovereign.  That's because the real Sovereign is the Eubacteriarch, a sentient bacterium that lives in Paul's nasal cavity.  The only academics more fascinated than the biologists are, of course, the memetosociologists, because Paul Vigotski invites the incredibly pressing question "how did this man get recognized as a nation?"</p></div>
<p>According to interviews with the Eubacteriarch, the Contagious Republic of Paul Vitgotski began with a bacterial infection that evolved sentience at the microbial level.  At the time of the Republic's formation, the Republic numbered around 3 million in population.  Each citizen was given one vote, to be shared by the descendants of that citizen after they underwent asexual reproduction.  Nowadays the Contagious Republic's population numbers around 230 trillion, making it the most populous nation on earth.  This makes votes in the Republic a highly scare commodity, often resulting in unrest that manifests as stomachaches.</p>
<p>The Contagious Republic's appearance on the National Stage came at an opportune moment, right as the <u>Very Definitely Independent States</u><sup>1</sup> began their propaganda campaign for independence.  The bacteria of the Republic worked out a way to hijack Vigotski's sensory and motor neurons, allowing for communication between the miniature Republic and the outside world.  In a speech before the Disputatious Assembly, the Eubacteriarch made its case for statehood, appropriating rhetoric used by the VDIS and their allies to all but ensure the support of that bloc.  Therefore, just as the VDIS were granted some dubious measure of statement, the Contagious Republic also managed to win a seat.</p>
<p>Elevating Paul Vigotski to statehood caused no end of political shenanigans.  Foremost of these was Vigotski's status as a citizen of <u>Selestei</u><sup>2</sup>, which made the bacteria's colonization of him technically count as an act of war.  Unfortunately for Selestei, while the Contagious Republic compelled Vigotski to sneeze on every door handle he encountered, the Selesteines could only prosecute the war by forcing Vigtoski to take antibiotics.  Vigotski, who was enjoying the media attention, refused.  The war continued in a subdued sort of manner for three years until both nations attended the <u>Massively Parallel Peace Conference</u><sup>3</sup> and settled on a compromise whereby Vigotski was awarded dual citizenship in both nations.</p>
<p>Today, the Contagious Republic has 32 human citizens, each of which hosts legions of bacterial researchers, artists, and businessgerms.  As such, the Republic's scientific, cultural, and financial output is nearly on par with nations with a much higher human population, and its GDP per capita is the best in the world.</p>

<p>1. The Very Definitely Independent States<br>2. Selestei<br>3. Massively Parallel Peace Conference</p><p>Ah, yes, I remember there was something of a conundrum in the 50's because it seemed like Vigotski himself was getting up there in years.  Everyone was wondering if they'd rename the country after whoever the Eubacteriarch colonized after Vigotski and what would happen to the voting populations that inhabited Vigotski's body.  But it seems like the Republic cracked the secret of cellular regeneration, since Vigotski hasn't aged a day in decades.  Once people figured it out, they were extremely eager to acquire the secret, but the Republic told everyone that they'd need to be colonized for the trick to work.  Interest died out after that.  The older I get, the more I think about taking the offer, but my wife has expressly forbid me from infecting myself just to live forever.  <i>C'est la vie!</i></p>

<p></p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>The Dark Pentad</h2><p>There was a time when academic institutions would award honorary degrees to individuals who had accomplished great things in the world.  The practice was quite advantageous for both parties; it allowed the university to benefit by associating with an individual of great merit, while the individual gained the status associated with the backing of a university.  But then the practice took a darker turn: in AES 845, the architect and attempted visionary Hans Flugelsson undertook a nationwide project to irrigate his desert homeland of Joran, but made several fatal errors in his calculations.  The results were <u>unfortunate</u><sup>1</sup>, to say the least, and Flugelsson became the recipient of immense ridicule from the international community.  In the midst of this uproar, the University of <u>Shaster</u><sup>2</sup> attempted a publicity stunt by awarding Flugelsson a degree in "Imagineering."</p></div>
<p>The immense positive response to this move led other universities to follow suit whenever public works programs went awry.  The emerging popularity of "dark degrees" was bolstered by the addition of <i>thanatology</i> in 849 for academics whose work led to a large number of deaths and <i>dysthetics</i> in 851 for artists whose work was just terrible.  These became known as the "Dark Triad" until <i>economics</i> was introduced in AES 891, for obvious reasons.  This led to some confusion over what to name these dishonorary degrees, a conversation that would not resolve until the first <i>misosophy</i> degree was awarded in 915 for egregious violations of scholarly norms.</p>
<p>Today, Pentad degrees are most often awarded in-house as the result of some internal investigation of wrongdoing.  While it's not uncommon for academics to accuse each other for political reasons, Pentad degrees are usually conferred only in extreme situations.  (There are <u>exceptions</u><sup>3</sup>, of course.)  Receiving a Pentad degree is typically a deathblow to one's career.  Knowing this, academics have developed complicated social customs built around mitigating the threat of possible accusations.  For example, should a shared research project provoke a Pentad hearing, the second-to-last author on the paper is typically summoned instead of the senior author, thus protecting the careers of established academics.  The scapegoat slot is naturally, therefore, filled by adjunct professors.</p>
<p>Despite the extreme stigma surrounding the Dark Pentad, however, they are each a functioning academic field.  Just like a legitimate academic field, they have journals, conferences, and even <u>advanced degree programs</u><sup>4</sup>.  Mainstream conferences try not to acknowledge Pentad academics, but it is common practice to block out time for "alternate perspectives," which is tacitly understood to be reserved for Pentad pariahs and naive professors who are about to spend the rest of their careers ignorant of why no one wants to co-author any papers with them.</p>

<p>I am concerned here particularly in the case of the <b>Double-North Pole</b>, which is a marvel of cartography and civic planning.  Let's begin with the history of this remarkable landmark.  Like anything cartographical, the tale's root can ultimately be found in the <u>Mapmaker's Guild</u><sup>1</sup>.  When the Earth was first completely charted in AES 489, the Venerable Cartographers experienced internal dissension over where to put the compass rose on their maps.  The arguments, I fear, began to turn political, as nationally-aligned factions of the transnational Society began drawing the compass rose over countries they disliked.</p>
<p>While this was going on, a discovery was in the works.  Now, as everyone knows, compasses don't work the same way in <u>the Barcu region</u><sup>2</sup> that they do anywhere else in the world.  But suppose you traveled to Barcu and found north, then traveled somewhere else and found north there.  If you were to draw a line from each of those points, their point of intersection is what we now call the Double-North Pole.  This was first theorized in AES 535 by Iryu Bandan, and confirmed in AES 547 by the famed explorer Vertrad the Swift.</p>
<p>Enter Candor Gunterman, a noble and patron of the Venerable Cartographers.  Wishing to see peace reign at last, he funded a major expedition to the Double-North Pole and founded the city of Bipolaris there.  That city became the seat of the Compass Republic, and they slowly expanded southward to claim more land in the shape of a compass rose, with Bipolaris forming the northern tip.  Gunterman, who remained monarch until AES 597, even had the foresight to shape the country such that it would have the correct proportions on a map using the Herzinger projection.</p>
<p>In recent years, Bipolaris has seen great economic growth as the seat of Sovereign <u>Klaus Santanna</u><sup>3</sup>, whose manufacturing innovations used the surrounding ice fields as heat sinks to massively increase production of goods.  The Double-North Pole's massive outpouring of goods has been aided by an unparalleled distribution network in the form of the <u>Ulgravian zeppelin armada</u><sup>4</sup>, who signed a lucrative trade deal with the Compass Republic in AES 980.</p>

The Ulgravian Diaspora</p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>Electric undead</h2><p>I got woken up at 3 AM this morning when a moaning corpse started pounding on my door.  I still don't have any idea how the fuck it got on this zeppelin.  Zeppelin security took like four hours to deal with it, and in the meantime I just had to sit there and think about how much sleep I wasn't getting.  It's been a shitty day.</p></div>
<p>The <b>electric undead</b>, like every horrible thing, hail from the Barcu region.  About fifteen hundred years ago, they started spreading.  The ones that went north froze, and the ones that went south found out the hard way that <u>Flandre</u><sup>1</sup> already had a National Response Protocol for dealing with contagious animated corpses.  But in the east was the warrior kingdom of Hantu.  Don't bother looking them up, they're all zombies now.  The morons found out that the electric undead spread through electrical contact, and all their swords were made of metal, and they <i>still</i> sent everyone at the rotting horde.</p>
<p>Despite the constant menace throughout history, we didn't make any progress understanding what was going on with the electric undead until the turn of the century, when none other than <u>Dr. Stafford</u><sup>2</sup> happened to them.  His research temple captured a few of them and vivisected them with ceramic tools, which allowed them to discover that the electrical activity in their nervous systems was actually <u>antilightning</u><sup>3</sup>, which explained why they act so weird.  Dr. Stafford's research allowed the Disuptatious Assembly of Sovereigns to pass the Electric Undead Quarantine Act.  Initially they wanted to drive the zombies into the sea, but the <u>whales</u><sup>4</sup> weren't having it.  So instead they tried to set up a fucking containment line on the Barcuvian border.  The Flandreans kept trying to set up protective measures, since <i>their</i> government has an entropology research division, but no one else wanted to spend the money and the Hegemon kept blocking them out of spite.</p>
<p>Look no further for proof that the DAS is full of idiots.  We've got this thing in entropology called "Chaos Theory," which is a theory that makes the following prediction: <i>If it causes chaos, it will happen</i>.  So at least none of <i>us</i> were surprised when one day <u>that Fitch fucker</u><sup>5</sup> tried to <u>sneak his students through the containment zone</u><sup>6</sup> and ended up letting all the zombies out into the world.  Now the rest of us have to deal with fucking zombies on our fucking zeppelins disrupting our fucking beauty sleep.  Fuck him.</p>

They are certainly <i>unsettling</i>, given their uncanny ability to deliver flowers anywhere, any time, no matter what security precautions are taken to keep them out. Despite their skill at infiltration dwarfing that of national intelligence agencies, the Order has never been definitively linked to any form of political violence or assassination. This is not to say that the Order has clean hands: it was a campaign of Order deliveries that finally drove the <u>Mad King Westler</u><sup>1</sup> completely insane in the ninth century. Nevertheless, if you're not the sort to be bothered by benign, nigh-omnipresent florists, the Order are at best an inconvenience.</p></div>
<p>The Esoteric Order of Florists is the heir to the Guild of Florists, distinguished as one of two such institutions to survive the decline of the guilds over the early centuries of <i>Anno Ecclesiae Superregum</i>. Like the <u>Mapmakers' Guild</u><sup>2</sup>, the Guild of Florists survived by evolving to transcend the guild system. While the cartographers increasingly militarized to bring the world into line with their maps, the florists developed secret techniques to fulfill more and more audacious contracts. Within the century, their powers of flower delivery had grown so threatening to international security that the Disputatious Assembly ordered countries in which they had guildhalls to implement oppressive controls to curb their power. Eventually, stymieing these measures became so cumbersome that the Guild of Florists announced that it was disbanding and closed all of its locations. There was a worldwide sigh of relief, until every sovereign in the Assembly received a bouquet with a note attached, reading "Thank you for your feedback. Signed, the Esoteric Order of Florists". Nobody knows where they operate out of now, though most suspect <u>Lepazzia</u><sup>3</sup>, their biggest state client, is sheltering them.</p>
<p>The secret to the Order's unmatched infiltration ability has been the subject of interminable debate. They have been suggested to be the keepers of secret cloaking technology discovered long ahead of their time, martial artists whose mastery of ancient <i>jutsu</i> allows them to move as freely and invisibly as the wind, spirits of the forest that can materialize freely in the mortal world, an international network of spies with the connections to get access to anywhere, and the fingers of a dark god breaking through to our world. World leaders such as <u>Klaus Santanna</u><sup>4</sup> have been accused of being Order members hiding in plain sight, and historical figures like <u>Pentex Lannogaster</u><sup>5</sup> are often suspected on account of the breadth of their escapades.</p>

<p>I've always felt this story captures both the genius of the Flandrean spirit as well as the tendency for that genius to go wrong in unexpected ways.  And of course the story is in their own words, which I think is the only proper way to learn about a people.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is always room for the perspectives of others, such as the researchers who study the archeological record of the ancient Flandreans.  Flandrean ruins are easy to identify because they're usually chock-full of the remains of primitive booby traps.  Entries in the archeological record indicate that ancient Flandreans originated in the Barcu region before migrating to the territory currently claimed by the Methodocracy of Flandre.  This of course does much to explain the cultural paranoia of Flandre, for if you can't even trust the <u>weather</u><sup>3</sup>, what <i>can</i> you trust?  In fact, some researchers believe ancient Flandreans might have actually invented the concept of government in order to coordinate their contingency plans.</p>
<p>Historically, Flandre has proved a tricky diplomatic partner (see also the <u>Roerbach Incident</u><sup>4</sup>), and the resulting trade deficit limited their economic growth.  It was only with the emergence of the Hegemony of Whales that their economy was able to boom, both as a result of oil trade and of renting space on their oil ships to nations that wish to avoid the Whale Tariffs.  Their cold war with the Hegemony of Whales has positioned them at the center of an anti-whale political bloc, along with the <u>Ulgravian Diaspora</u><sup>5</sup>, whose zeppelin fleet creates an existential need for continued oil trade.</p>

Everyone over in Selestei loves Flandre, despite the fact that from a Selesteine point of view Flandrean culture is essentially institutionalized cowardice.  Meanwhile, Flandre appears to take every possible opportunity to fuck Selestei over.  But no matter how hard they try, Selestei somehow manages to avoid the vast majority of the negative consequences.  Not only that, but they don't even seem to have noticed this has been going on.  You should have seen <u>Ironheart</u><sup>2</sup>'s eye twitching when Daggert gave her a bear hug last week, it was the most <i>hilarious</i> shit.</p>

High Exarch Minor Seraphi Ironheart</p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>Flandrean National Response Protocol BX-392a</h2><p>The <b>Flandrean National Response Protocol BX-392a</b>, popularly known as the <b>"Inordinate Number of Snakes" Protocol</b>, is the National Response Protocol (Biological Existential Threat) that replaced NRP BX-392, the "Ordinate Number of Snakes" Protocol. BX-392a was ratified by the <u>High Exarch Minor Seraphi Ironheart</u><sup>1</sup> upon her ascension in AES 990, bringing an end to the civil unrest in which Flandre had become embroiled following High Exarch Cerberus Ironheart's untimely demise in AES 988 at the "hands" of <u>Buddy "Literally Made of Snakes" Johnson</u><sup>2</sup>. Though her detractors launched a protest movement alleging that a twelve-year-old girl couldn't possibly be old enough to understand the correct precautions to take against a large number of snakes, Ironheart proved herself a true daughter of Flandre by having no fewer than three contingency plans prepared for protest movements questioning her competency based on her age, the second of which was later enshrined as National Response Protocol PU-36.</p></div>
<p>Previous Flandrean attempts to define response protocols for various quantities of snakes were limited by available data, as the greatest quantity of snakes the country had ever dealt with occurred during the Snake Rain of AES 954. This event proved the efficacy of the preparations outlined in BX-391, allowing the draft version of BX-392 to be completed and ratified. Yet the number of snakes that fell in the Snake Rain paled in comparison to the inordinate serpentine resources of Buddy Johnson, forcing Flandre, uncharacteristically, to improvise. The desperate, haphazard use of any and all halfway-relevant National Response Protocols led the country to the brink of civil war, necessitating a Protocol that could end the snake menace.</p>
<p>The newly ascended HEM Ironheart, soon to be renowned for her lateral thinking, initially formulated BX-392a after the model of BX-233g, the Protocol dealing specifically with termites resistant to the poisons prescribed in BX-233f. This was met with resistance from the Council of Exarchs on pragmatic grounds, who rejected her proposed plans for the vehicle that would carry the vanguard flamethrowers. In defiance of the Council's opposition, Ironheart formulated an ingenious plan to convince the <u>"Killer Bus"</u><sup>3</sup> of neighboring Kingsland to aid her designs. The Council could not argue with the results and ratified the updated BX-392a.</p>
<p>The success of the new Protocol, no doubt aided by the Killer Bus's longstanding rivalry with "Literally Made of Snakes" Johnson, served to revitalize the Flandrean heavy weapons and cryotechnology industries. The subsequent economic boom has made the High Exarch Minor the darling of her people and cemented her control over the country. This contributes to Flandre's vicious opposition to the Disarrangement Act, which would likely result in Flandre being separated from Kingsland and thus necessitate a reformulation of the "Inordinate Number of Snakes" Protocol's vanguard flamethrower section &mdash; an uneasy prospect for the young sovereign.</p>

The Fractured Cities are comprised by over fifty eternally bickering city states within a somewhat secluded territory, and all of them are <i>awesome</i>.  Technically the whole mess is one big country, but that's basically just a legal fiction maintained by whatever Hierarch managed to win the last civil war and claim the Sovereignty, and everyone else goes along with it because they don't want to have to deal with a repeat of the whole <u>Very Definitely Independent States</u><sup>4</sup> situation.  Plus you just know that if you brought all fifty-six Hierarchs into the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns, the session would end with two thirds of them dead, a handful of bystander casualties, and the building on fire.</p></div>
<p>The signature cultural activity of the Fractured Cities is called, no shit, a "<u>bloodmoot</u><sup>5</sup>," and it's basically this giant game of assassination chicken where both sides pretend it's a peaceful diplomatic conference until one of them has their assassins shoot first.  But then maybe they find that the assassins were bought off and now they're getting shot in the back.  Or possibly their food had an extra poison besides the one they already took an antidote for and they don't even get to give the signal.  It's possible for neither side to make a move the whole time, of course, but then you've lost because you just sat through a whole diplomatic conference and how long will those agreements stand up in the Fractured Cities anyways?  Television turned the lot of you into brain-rotted zombies, but televised bloodmoots with expert commentary nearly redeem the whole enterprise.</p>
<p>See, entropologists detail two strategies people take to dealing with the inevitable breakdown of all order and goodness.  The first strategy is the one adopted by most modern societies, and it's fucking terrible.  They try and impose order on the natural chaos that is people trying appease their stupid animal brains, and invariably the whole thing grinds itself into disaster and stupidity; see also <u>Incendia</u><sup>6</sup>.  But in the second approach, people embrace chaos and don't pretend like they're better than feral monkeys just because their mating contests are more ambiguous.  That's the approach the Fractured Cities took.  Sure they're at war all the time, but they've been in a pretty stable state of unrest since like a thousand years ago.  Most so-called "organized" nations have collapsed, like, twice in that same time period.  Three times if the Disarrangement Act passes.  You can bet the Fractured Cities will survive that shit.</p>

When the Cetacean Wars broke out in the 920s, he enlisted in the Flandrean military, where his exceptional leadership and near-preternatural ability to anticipate and account for surprises made him rise to the rank of captain by the end of the war. When the Cetacean Wars were ended in 929 by the Assembly's official recognition of <u>the Hegemony of Whales</u><sup>2</sup>, Gorson was quoted as saying, "Let the blowers have the bloody oceans, it'll give 'em somewhere to hide nex' time I come to rip 'em a second hole." Nor was this a mere boast, as Gorson did in fact rip a whale a new blowhole during the Second Battle of Lords' Cove, whence his nickname, "Ripper". His deep and enduring hatred for the whales of the Hegemony has made his name &mdash; or, at least, the whale noises they use to name him &mdash; an expletive in the planet's oceans.</p></div>
<p>Despite his extraordinary success and eventual promotion to the rank of general, Gorson was often sidelined on the national stage because of his fringe views. Like any Flandrean, Gorson was extremely adept at planning for any and every contingency. Unlike his peers, however, Gorson's contingency planning was uncharacteristically <i>preemptive</i>. For Flandre, the future is sacred, and interacting with it must be done receptively. The essential element of Flandrean piety is precisely to let the future happen as it may, and their reverence for it is constituted by planning for it no matter what it brings to pass. Gorson, the only Flandrean officer to execute an ambush that wasn't a counter-ambush, was thus a cultural pariah, because he tried to shape the future actively rather than reactively.</p>
<p>Even though he was kept out of the spotlight, "Ripper" Gorson was still a military genius. He remained a mainstay of the Council of Exarchs, advising the Council on military matters even after his retirement in 973. Sadly, he became somewhat unhinged in his later years, advocating for such policies as helping <u>Selestei</u><sup>3</sup> destroy <u>Zor Olo</u><sup>4</sup>, or declaring war on <u>horseball</u><sup>5</sup> &mdash; not <i>players</i> of horseball, mind you, but the abstract concept of the sport. He died at home in 984 at the age of 81.</p>
<p>A portrait of General Kade "Ripper" Gorson hangs in the Butterfly Effect Advisory Committee's break room, to remind us all of the importance of shaping the future proactively. Personally, ever since the unlikely series of coincidences that landed me in this closet, I've considered him a role model for his perseverance despite being relegated to the fringe.</p>

Recognized by the Assembly in AES 929 following the Cetacean Wars of the 920s, the hyperintelligent whales of the Hegemony lay claim to all of the planet's oceans as their sovereign territory, covering more than two-thirds of the surface. Through a quirk of wording in the Assembly's charter, voting power is described in terms of <i>seats</i>; the Hegemon, therefore, whose girth takes up an entire wing of seats, possesses nearly a third of the votes, depending on how massive the current occupant of the position is. (It is not a coincidence that this precipitated the breakup of the Union into the <u>Very Definitely Independent States</u><sup>1</sup>, nor that the Hegemony was the first to ratify the States each receiving a seat.) The admission of the Hegemony caused a fundamental change in the politics of the Assembly, which was allowed to happen when the first Hegemon, Bueoueou the Great, threatened to roll over the opposition. While the Assembly's sudden change of policy towards ocean preservation was the first and most obvious effect, more subtle consequences were to follow.</p></div>
<p>Though the Hegemony is an axis of international politics, it lacks a strong economic base, being entirely underwater. The hyperintelligent whales, while hyperintelligent, are whales, and thus lack the fine motor control required for most skilled professions. In order to make the Hegemony an economic power on par with its political power, Hegemon Aouwouou instituted the Whale Tariffs, a tax on all ships passing through Hegemony territory, i.e. the oceans. This had wide-reaching economic effects, the most notable of which was the ascension of <u>Flandre</u><sup>2</sup> as an economic powerhouse. Because Flandre's economy is mostly oil-based, the High Exarch was able to equip every ship in the Flandrean fleet with significant amounts of oil, effectively turning the Hegemony's threat to sink noncompliant ships into mutually assured destruction. This defiance to the Whale Tariffs has put them at the center of the Assembly bloc that forms the main opposition to the Hegemon's vote. It has not been a <i>carte blanche</i> resistance, however; after the weaponization of the <u>Taurus Research Station</u><sup>3</sup>, the Hegemony banned <u>General Gorson</u><sup>4</sup> from sea travel, which Flandre wisely heeded.</p>
<p>The Hegemony of Whales proposed the Disarrangement Act in AES 989 in advance of the Assembly's millenial. The Hegemony's reasons for the Act are not difficult to infer: rearranging all the countries in the world will undoubtedly require shipping some of them to different continents, an unimaginably profitable opportunity for the Hegemony. It also stands to neutralize the threat Flandre poses to it, as long as Flandre's new location has less oil in it.</p>

<p>1. Flandre<br>2. The Ulgravian Diaspora</p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>High Exarch Minor Seraphi Ironheart</h2><p>In the <u>Methodocracy of Flandre</u><sup>1</sup>, it is not just the strong who survive.  The strong are often overconfident, so they don't prepare enough for eventual failure.  Flandreans instead celebrate the <i>crafty</i>, who so often bring down the strong,  and Flandrean institutions reflect that fact faithfully.</p></div>
<p>Methodocracy, or "rule by schemes," is by design a difficult-to-understand system of government.  In fact, many of the protocols of the Methodocracy are kept confidential to prevent exploitation by external or internal powers.  However, it is known that the High Exarch is chosen not on the basis of any personal merit, but based on whether their proposed solution to the current national crisis is more effective than the others.  Nominally this would include a proposal from the current High Exarch, but High Exarchs have a habit of coincidentally winding up dead whenever a situation rises to the level of a national crisis.</p>
<p>You can read more about <b>High Exarch Minor Seraphi Ironheart</b>'s ascension in Dr. Rubric's <u>treatment</u><sup>2</sup> of the Inordinate Number of Snakes protocol, but my topic here is Ironheart's conduct as High Exarch Minor.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, the case of a 12-year-old whose defense proposal was rejected by the Council.  For most little girls, that would be the end of their political endeavors, for that is the way society tells them that the process works.  Soon-to-be-HEM Ironheart instead traveled north to Kingsland—foolhardy in its own right—persuaded an <u>eldritch abomination</u><sup>3</sup> to participate in her scheme, and then barbecued half the Council with a flamethrower while riding atop said eldritch abomination.  Rubric writes "they could not argue with the results"—indeed, indeed!  It was a brilliant political move, for not only did she demonstrate the worthiness of her proposal, but she also boldly demonstrated that the Council didn't have a contingency plan for getting baked alive.</p>
<p>Now 14, Ironheart's leadership has remained no less decisive or flashy.  Most controversial, of course, was her decision to establish a military base on the lip of the <u>Missing Sea</u><sup>4</sup> as a foothold for research and colonization.  Ironheart correctly identified that Flandre was the only nation in a position both to exploit the resources on the open sea floor and to stave off the wrath of the whales that would follow such a course.  And the public relations strategies she employed to address, mollify, rebut, and/or disappear her detractors once again demonstrate the deftness of her contingency planning.</p>
<p>While there are several obvious reasons of practicality underlying Flandre's resistance to the Disarrangement Act, proponents of the Act might consider that they do not want an irritated High Exarch Minor Seraphi Ironheart on their borders.</p>

The sport grew out of an <u>Ulgravian</u><sup>1</sup> pastime, from before the country took to the skies, where mounted warriors would tie their shields concave-out to their hands and toss a ball to each other. The rules of horseball have been thoroughly systematized since those days, with glove size regulated and ball make standardized. Most institutions of secondary education will take their classes on a field trip to a horseball course, and many post-secondary institutions have horseball teams that bring in fans and provide scholarships.</p></div>
<p>Competitive horseball has been praised as uniting the venerable practice of horse breeding with the fast-paced action of other ball-type team sports, while retaining those qualities that allow fans to participate in the collective identity of their college, city, or country. Professional horseballers are widely regarded as celebrities. Because it requires a horse, of course, standard horseball is not a common leisure activity. Fans wanting to play it themselves will generally run around sans horse, ride on the shoulders of another player, or use roller skates. Rarely, amateur horseball is played on motorcycles, which is generally discouraged by the International Horseball Council (IHC).</p>
<p>While <u>Selestei</u><sup>2</sup> does know of a sport by the name "horseball", it is not the same sport as played in the rest of the world. Instead of players on horses passing around a ball, Selesteine horseball involves players passing around a horse rolled up into a ball. Selesteine horseball teams are allowed to compete in the same brackets as international horseball teams through a byzantine set of adapter rules composed by <u>the peerless Dr. Stafford</u><sup>3</sup>. Inexplicably, the matchup is quite balanced.</p>
<p>This benevolence came back to bite the international horseball community when Selestei won its first World Trough in 933. In the ensuing chaos of their victory/national anthem, the Selesteine team rolled the opposing team's horses into a giant ball and threw it into the audience. Inspired by this, Johnson, Johnson, & Several Other Johnsons, an <u>Incendian</u><sup>4</sup> <u>mad lawyer cabal</u><sup>5</sup>, delved into Stafford's adapter rules and produced an extensively cross-referenced report a week later arguing that this was a legal move in adapted horseball. The 934 horseball season was subsequently dominated by the so-called "Selsroll" strategy until the IHC's own legal team could deconstruct JJ&SOJ's argument and restore a modicum of sensibility to the sport.</p>
<p>Selestei seems to be the only country to have gotten away with such an egregious perversion of the rules. When the <u>Lepazzian</u><sup>6</sup> team's goal was suddenly found to have been <u>filled with flowers</u><sup>7</sup> last year, preventing the other team from scoring, the Lepazzian team was politely asked to withdraw and suggested to refrain from entering for the next year.</p>

I don't.  There hasn't been a decent Assembly since like AES 26 when Jain Kantamon <u>convinced the international community that dragons were a thing</u><sup>1</sup>.  Even then, well, the idiots all thought that dragons existed.</p></div>
<p>So there's this thing in entropology called Angrand's Equation, which describes the efficacy of government as a function of the time since its founding.  Unsurprisingly to anyone who knows about entropology, the graph just keeps going downward.  You meatheads think the Assembly is any different?  Then read 'em and fucking weep, because either you don't know about the <b>I'll Legislate it, I Swear, Don't Think I Won't Act</b>, or your TV-rotted excuse for a brain is in too much of a stupor to understand the implications.</p>
<p>The ILIISDTIWA is, simply put, the nadir of not just the Assembly, but also of <i>civilization in general</i>.  It started with some wag deciding to curb the power of the <u>Esoteric Order of Florists</u><sup>2</sup>, never mind that all they do is deliver fucking flowers to hard-to-reach areas, and never mind that if your jumped-up, fancy-pants "national security" can't stop a bunch of florists there's no way they'll listen when a gaggle of politicians tells them off for it.  Whatever.  Tale as old as time.</p>
<p>So next thing that happens is people start adding on all these other riders to the Act.  And I'll give them this: the founders of the Assembly knew this was going to be a problem, so there are provisions in the Charter that force people to remain at least notionally on topic when they try to stick their overbearing regal genitals in a piece of legislation.  But look at the fucking title on this piece of shit!  Can you think of anything you <i>can't</i> legislate with a title like that?  "Hur hur, what about legislating not thinking they won't" <i>no dice, you corpulent weasel, the fuckers did that too</i>.</p>
<p>Even the shit that went wrong didn't go right, because the Assembly is full of opportunists who want to find a nice, convenient legislative vehicle to outlaw their favorite pet peeve.  The I'll Legislate It Act opened the floodgates on a tsunami of excrement.  There were sections that outlawed voting with your left hand, and lunchtime, and famously even <i>other sections of the same fucking Act</i>.  And so of course it got to the point where nobody actually wanted this legislative atrocity to go through, because their own citizens would have them drawn and quartered.  But they had also spent way too many favors getting this thing set up, so they couldn't vote against.  So on voting day, one by one, every stinkin' Sovereign in the building voted to abstain.  But they forgot one critical detail: <u>Lepazzia</u><sup>3</sup> always votes in favor.</p>

Lepazzia</p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>Incendia</h2><p><b>Incendia</b> was and allegedly still is a prosperous city-state on the northern border of <u>Lepazzia</u><sup>1</sup>. In AES 972, in the face of increasing pressure from <u>the Hegemony of Whales</u><sup>2</sup>, Incendia massively scaled up efforts to harvest the country's rich oil deposits. This brought great prosperity to Incendia with a rapidity aided by a disregard for an accompanying Flandrean level of contingency planning. As a result, the entire country collapsed into a giant sinkhole during the 974 Open Flame Festival, the inauspicious timing of which ignited the gas deposits, creating the still-burning conflagration we know today.</p></div>
<p>At the time of the Festival, Incendia's president, Iyano Niir, was at a session of the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns. The <u>Ulgravian</u><sup>3</sup> sovereign motioned to have Niir dismissed from the Assembly, on the grounds that because Incendia no longer existed, he was no longer a sovereign; the motion was, as usual, seconded by Lepazzia. President Niir's subsequent defense of his continued presence is widely considered one of the greatest orations given in the Assembly this century. According to Niir, Incendia had only been mildly perturbed by the multiple-story drop into the sinkhole, and hadn't been destroyed in the slightest. The perpetual fire that now burned in the pit where his country once was, he scoffed, was not the burnoff of their gas deposits, but rather what their national festivals looked like from above. He exhorted those who sought to remove him from the Assembly to desist from their cultural myopia and recognize the heritage of Incendia and their peculiar means of celebration. To any who persisted, he challenged them to go to Incendia themselves and prove that there wasn't a country underneath the roiling curtain of flame, though he warned that the country was very welcoming and visitors might find themselves unable to leave. The subsequent vote to eject Incendia from the Assembly narrowly failed, thanks to the intervention of the Hegemon of Whales, though Niir was unable to stop the Assembly's notaries from subtracting the sinkhole's area from Incendia's officially recorded landmass.</p>
<p>Today, Incendia remains in somewhat of a precarious position. President Niir currently lives off of the complimentary snacks provided at Assembly breakout sessions and sleeps in the Butterfly Effect Advisory Committee's break room, because it has the softest couch. Every now and then the Committee chases him out, but I can hear him snoring in the air ducts from the basement, and he's always back by the end of the week. The Incendian military, Gregor Gregory, is currently stationed in their embassy in <u>the Panark Fleet</u><sup>4</sup>. The Incendian military being entirely stationed inside another country is the cause of some international tension, which Niir insists is "not a big deal, and besides, Gregor's very agreeable." The Incendian Tourism Bureau continues Niir's foreign policy by publishing pamphlets about how much Indencians love festivals that obscure the country from above, but its suggested travel destinations are all Incendian embassies in other countries, which have set up farms and become self-sufficient on their small plots of land.</p>

Unfortunately for Kingslanders, the city-state is practically <i>made</i> of dark alleys. It's sometimes said that if you stretched out all of Kingsland's alleys and roads next to each other, the alleys would go further, but neither would get you far enough to escape whatever was chasing you. Because of the dangers lurking in the omnipresent alleys, Kingslanders try to stick to the city's labyrinthine public transit system, despite its sanity-defying complexity. Visitors are often surprised by such transit irregularities as subway tracks that spin the train in a barrel roll, a monorail track that loops Kingsland South but never in the same way twice, one road where the buses go off a ramp to avoid a chasm, and the strange phenomenon where the station bathroom stalls transport people to <u>the Double-North Pole</u><sup>1</sup>. Kingslanders are nothing if not resigned, however, and they bear this with faces hollow and spirits deflated.</p></div>
<p>But the transit system isn't always the safer option. The first "Killer Bus" incident occurred in AES 976. The doors on a bus in Kingsland North suddenly locked, and onlookers described the windows as being "instantly painted" with blood. In what Kingslanders call "a good day", the screaming was brief. The bus continued its route as normal, though few dared to board once they saw every surface on the inside covered in viscera. It is unknown whether the bus's driver was also killed, but a bus with no driver isn't even worth mentioning in Kingsland, so we don't know either way. Similar incidents continue to occur in Kingsland North, each time involving a slightly different method. The Killer Bus has protruded spikes, turned flat and fallen on top of passersby, transformed into a giant robot to fight another local horror, and driven straight into the river that divides the city in order to hit a passing <u>Panark diplomatic envoy</u><sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>The Killer Bus's <u>cult</u><sup>3</sup> has grown to be one of the largest in Kingsland. In 986, on the anniversary of the first Killer Bus incident, the cult began rallying to elect the Killer Bus as the sovereign of Kingsland. This movement has gained popular appeal outside of the cult, as the citizens hope that the Killer Bus will be forced to leave Kingsland in order to attend sessions of the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns. Flandre has expressed support for the movement in recognition of the Killer Bus's aid in the success of <u>NRP BX-392a</u><sup>4</sup>. This support has more than one motive, though, as electing foreign threats to the Assembly to keep tabs on them is prescribed by NRP TX-43d.</p>

The mayor of Kingsland has expressed uncertainty as to the Killer Bus's candicacy: on one hand, the Bus would take up two rows of seats, giving Kingsland unprecedented voting power in the Disputatious Assembly; on the other hand, it would mean he would have to go back to living in Kingsland.</p>

My neighbors got eaten by something last summer and the flat's been vacant long enough that I'm sure whatever did it has moved on. It's the least sacrifice he could make for his country. Over here in Kingsland South, we'd kill to get that many Assembly votes, and I can't imagine how the Northerners would feel to have the Killer Bus off the streets.</p>

In this section we will focus on the nation of <b>Lepazzia</b>, which is as beautiful as it is misunderstood by outsiders.</p></div>
<p>Most known to foreigners is the Lepazzian custom of being agreeable past the point of sanity.  But this is an incomplete simplification.  It is true that in Lepazzian culture, disagreement is unconscionable and violence is beyond barbaric.  But  when we caricature Lepazzians as being wholy unaggressive, we overlook their long and vicious history of <i>passive</i>-aggression.  Within a family, for example, children might negotiate their sibling rivalries through indirect means, breaking each other's possessions or manipulating their parents into favoring one or the other child.  At the national level, the techniques employed can be truly harrowing.  One recalls the tension of the Eight Days' War, in which five nations simultaneously declared war on Lepazzia before withdrawing it eight days later upon finding <u>flowers in the bedrooms of every major government official</u><sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>In the Assembly, Lepazzia has an international reputation for always voting in favor, regardless of the bill or motion put to the floor.  This, too, is an artifact of Lepazzian culture which is often misunderstood.  The Lepazzian Senate votes unanimously in favor of whatever is put to the Senate floor.  However, before any motion is put forward, there are days of politicking and maneuvering to determine what should happen.  Lepazzian Senators find themselves confronted with aggrieved notes on their seats, unpleasant rumors, and personal attacks in the newspapers.  You will find no one so hardened against human pettiness than a Lepazzian politician, and yet a few reliably commit suicide every year.  In any case the Sovereign of Lepazzia does little with his votes—and, it must be said, looks vaguely horrified every time someone votes against a measure—but you can be sure that behind the scenes, he has brutally crushed the self esteem of multiple Sovereigns.  I myself once heard the Sovereign of <u>Incendia</u><sup>2</sup> break down in tears after a particularly belittling conference, although to be fair he does that all the time, the poor dear.</p>
<p>With regard to the Disarrangement Act, I heartily encourage the Assembly to consider that Lepazzia's new neighbors will be subject to unimaginable psychological torment, and that we could see the emergence of trauma at a cultural level.  This will make selecting suitably hardy countries difficult.  It is not accidental, remember, that <u>Ulgrav</u><sup>3</sup> disposed of all of its land after a mere three hundred years on the Lepazzian border.</p>

<p>1. The Esoteric Order of Florists<br>2. Incendia<br>3. The Ulgravian Diaspora</p><p>Lepazzia keeps something of a low profile in the international community, but it's important to remember their ostensible neutrality doesn't translate to a neutral impact on global politics.  For example, if the Lepazzian Sovereign had truly wanted to agree with the other Sovereigns, he would have also abstained on the <u>I'll Legislate It Act</u><sup>1</sup> instead of voting in favor.  And the <u>Massively Parallel Peace Conference</u><sup>2</sup> illustrates, perhaps a little more clearly, that Lepazzia has it out for all of us.  It might be wise to look past the cultural differences between us and realize that they probably consider themselves, in their own way, to be at war with everyone else.</p>

<p>1. The I'll Legislate It, I Swear, Don't Think I Won't Act<br>2. Massively Parallel Peace Conference</p><p>In a way, we have Lepazzia to thank for the Disarrangement Act. When their cultural passive-aggression had reached new heights in the fourth century, they literally drew a line in the sand and dug a massive trench around their entire country to make a point to their neighbors on <u>the Careless Continent</u><sup>1</sup>. While most geologists are confused as to how merely digging a trench could result, as it did, in Lepazzia drifting off into the ocean, in my opinion as a sociophysicist, this is no mystery at all. Lepazzian culture is nothing if not one that keeps others at arms' length. The Lepazzian Split was simply the physical manifestation of the social phenomenon in accordance with the principles of sociophysics.</p>

The participants for the experiments, run by the <u>National Academy of Velskyavo</u><sup>3</sup>, were chosen by a single-elimination endurance tournament in which bands were required to play music while undergoing astronaut training. The Lunchtime Fallacy narrowly defeated their opponents in the finals, the neometal classical band Sneezing on the King Eternal, when Sneezing's drummer fell unconscious in the third hour inside the multiaxis g-force machine and lost his grip on his drumsticks, which flew out at high speed and knocked out their bassist. In the maiden voyage of the warp-equipped shuttle &mdash; christened as the <i>Rainbow's Teeth</i> by Lunchtime's lead singer, Groz Hoffman &mdash; The Lunchtime Fallacy entered warp with a performance of their hit single "Hit Me With a Truck" and exited five minutes later on the other side of the world in Lepazzia, where they played a few numbers for a surprised crowd before warping back to Katskria with an encore of "Ain't No Whale".</p></div>
<p>The Lunchtime Fallacy rode on this fame for a few years, until they were inadvertently banned by the <u>Don't Think I Won't Act</u><sup>4</sup>. Now international criminals guilty only of the crime of having a pretty sweet band name, they broke into the National Academy's warp research wing and stole the <i>Rainbow's Teeth</i>, making their getaway with the debut performance of "But You'll Never Take Our Trousers". Through the careful manipulation of time signatures, Lunchtime was able to introduce time dilation into their warp travel, spending only a day inside the warp before materializing in the capital of <u>Shaster</u><sup>5</sup> three months later. Thereafter, Lunchtime became temporal vagrants, appearing out of the warp on the crest of a song and playing a gig long enough for their agent to grab more food from the nearest market before disappearing back into the ether. Because they spend more time in warp than with the rest of us, the members of Lunchtime appear to have only aged a few years since they began their journey through space and time thirty years ago.</p>
<p>Before their exodus, The Lunchtime Fallacy's lyrics focused on themes of the difficulty of engaging in politics in an increasingly globalized world and the marginalization of smaller communities. Their later, post-Act work has abandoned this to become more abstract and disconnected, a trend that National Academy researchers are worried represents long-term detrimental effects from extended warp exposure.</p>

Before the days of the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns, civilization's best shot at physics was knowing that rocks fall back down after you catapult them.  Likewise, "law" was doing whatever the king said.</p></div>
<p>We can follow this trend up to the present day: as civilization developed, the haphazard, <i>ad hoc</i> systems of ancient history were replaced with one regulated by rules and independently verifiable procedure.  This paradigm defined the core of legal practice as we know it today.</p>
<p>However, physics encountered a conceptual revolution with the development of quantum mechanics and the grudging acceptance that the old rules might not apply consistently.  So, too, has the practice of law undergone a conceptual revolution—one resulting in the field of practice colloquially known as <b>mad law</b>.</p>
<p>The original mad lawyer is widely considered to be Kelsi Hanover, whose <u>Shastrian</u><sup>1</sup> legal practice had fallen on a run of difficult cases at the time.  The final straw was a 894 case in which she had to defend a client who had committed a crime while remote-controlled by future Sovereign <u>Klaus Santanna</u><sup>2</sup>.  This matter dragged the trial into convoluted matters of international law and extradition, further worsened by the fact that the crime was not illegal in the <u>Compass Republic</u><sup>3</sup>, where Santanna had been at the time of the event.  Hanover motioned for a fifteen-day "epiphany recess," which is a common Shastrian practice in cases where one or more participants in a trial receive sudden, urgent inspiration for a brilliant idea.  At the end of the recess, Hanover returned with a modal legal framework that applied sections of various laws conditionally and/or hypothetically, allowing the trial to proceed across multiple counterfactuals simultaneously.</p>
<p>(The judge is said to have commented "This is the maddest thing I've ever seen" before acquitting her defendant, thus explaining the name, but that statement is widely considered by scholars to be apocryphal.)</p>
<p>The fundamental insight behind mad law is an essentially memetosociological one—laws do not merely exist and thereby shape society; they must also be enforced and applied to any given circumstance.  Consequently, it is necessary to select <i>which</i> laws must apply if you wish them applied; conversely, if you wish no laws applied, all you have to do is fail to apply them.  In his journals, <u>St. Stafford</u><sup>4</sup> wrote that such thinking to him was indispensable in forming his early approach to problems like his adaptation of the rules of <u>horseball</u><sup>5</sup> or the construction of the <u>Zeitgeist Manipulator</u><sup>6</sup>.</p>
<p>The practice of mad law has seen greater acceptance in the modern day, but it faces opposition from more traditional lawyers, as well as the <u>Hegemony of Whales</u><sup>7</sup>, which maintains the whole endeavor is a <u>Flandrean</u><sup>8</sup> plot.</p>

Flandre</p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>Marionette children</h2><p>The fisher crow (<i>Corvus bastardus</i>), also known as the bastard crow, the marionette crow, or metonymically as a marionette child, is a curious scavenger corvid native to the <u>Razor Valley</u><sup>1</sup> region of <u>Shaster</u><sup>2</sup> and <u>Selestei</u><sup>3</sup>. Fisher crows are distinguished by their long and lean bodies, but most especially by the extremely thin, prehensile tendrils that trail from their claws. These tendrils are capable of cutting through flesh with ease. Unexpectedly for something that isn't from Barcu, however, fisher crows usually refrain from using their tendrils to hunt prey directly, and instead prefer the much more horrifying method of using them to control child-size marionette puppets. The popular sobriquet "<b>marionette children</b>" was first used to refer to these puppets, but these days it is often used to refer to the fisher crows themselves.</p></div>
<p>Fisher crows are omnivorous, eating fruits, nuts, insects, other birds, and carrion. They will not hesitate to prey on live animals, even larger livestock or the occasional human. When they attack live prey much larger than themselves, they approach from above, seize it with their marionette, and then carry it off into the sky. Some research was once attempted into how it is that fisher crows can lift large prey when they appear to have no more lifting power than other birds, but this was done by having volunteers bait fisher crows into carrying them off, which resulted in a cancelled research program and a complimentary <u>thanatology degree</u><sup>4</sup>. It is no longer considered an open research question.</p>
<p>An international incident was precipitated in AES 967 when it was discovered that <u>The Contagious Republic of Paul Vigotski</u><sup>5</sup> had colonized a fisher crow. The Assembly immediately began disputing whether the more pressing issue was that the Republic has developed the capability to infect across species or that it had now had the use of a marionette child. In the confusion, Vigotski himself slipped away, prompting the Assembly to order the <u>Taurus Research Station</u><sup>6</sup> to be turned planetside for the first time, ostensibly for observation. Vigotski was caught in the parking lot and returned to the Assembly, where the assembled sovereigns ordered the Republic to turn over the infected bird for termination. The Republic, rather <i>too</i> easily, complied. Since the crow was technically a citizen of the Contagious Republic, the extradition paperwork took a week to get straight, at which point it was summarily executed and the corpse burned. Ever since then, there seem to be an awful lot of crows in the trees around the Assembly building.</p>

Like, any entropologist will tell you that things get shittier over time, but they didn't need to fuck things up <i>this</i> badly.</p></div>
<p>So, 940 was when all this shit started going downhill.  <u>Selestei</u><sup>1</sup> and the <u>germs</u><sup>2</sup> were at war, <u>Flandre</u><sup>3</sup> and the <u>whales</u><sup>4</sup> were at it, half the <u>Careless Continent</u><sup>5</sup> was at war with other countries and the other half were at war with themselves—basically it was the most war we've had since the <u>War of Durun's Ass</u><sup>6</sup>, except this time the little twerps couldn't even muster the self-awareness to form teams first.</p>
<p>So along comes fucking <u>Lepazzia</u><sup>7</sup> and tells everyone they're showing up to a peace conference.  And of course everyone comes, because Lepazzia doesn't really throw its weight around but holy shit do you not want to get on their bad side.  So everyone shows up and the Lepazzian Sovereign Assface Bumblefuck—okay, not actually his name, but it might as well be—Bumblefuck gives this speech about everyone's going to make nice so they can feel good.  And this lot is all politicians, they might have developmentally disabled squirrels for brains but they can read between the lines when someone's threatening them, so they all hurry into their assigned rooms and sign the quickest, dirtiest treaties they can.</p>
<p>So, like, think about that.  Peace treaties are supposed to shape the conduct of the nations involved, right?  And if two nations are <i>at war</i>, then those nations probably have some fucking issues, right?  After all, only an inbred cretin would think that nations go to war for <i>no fucking reason,</i> right?  So given all that, if the original issues still exist, and you still make those nations sign a <i>shitty peace treaty</i>, then <i>what the fuck do you think happens next?</i></p>
<p>I fucking swear, you can trace every political catastrophe in the last fifty years to this disaster of a conference.  The first problem, obviously, is that this is peak Lepazzia here.  Like, passive-aggressively threatening people with passive-aggression to force them to self-sabotage?  I don't know why we didn't bomb the fuckers into radioactive shrapnel three centuries ago.  Fucking cowardly Sovereign.  </p>
<p>Anyways, second problem once the first half of the Careless Continent stopped fighting each other, they all had civil wars, and once the other half finished their civil wars they started fighting each other.  Flandre and the Hegemony are in cold war still, and that's basically the main reason we have to deal with this Disarrangement Act bullshit in the first place.  The <i>only</i> decent peace that came out of this is that Selestei and the Contagious Republic aren't at war, and <i>that wasn't even a proper war in the first place!</i>  Like, fuck, it was some twit sneezing on doorknobs because he refused to take his medicine!  How is that a war, you fuckers?  Get over here, I'll show you you some fucking war.</p>

Ever since its disappearance &mdash; or rather, <i>appearance</i>, in a sense &mdash; in the year AES 25, it has defied any and all explanation as to why all of the ocean off the coast of Kingsland is just <i>not there</i>. For most scholars, after nearly a millennium of study, the consensus is that it has something to do with <u>antiweather</u><sup>2</sup> and that prying further is asking for trouble. Trying to investigate too deeply into anything in the vicinity of Kingsland is usually a fast-track ticket to being spoken of in the past tense, and the usual madness of Barcu extends into the Missing Sea as well.</p></div>
<p>This, of course, is no obstacle to the crackpots and <u>pentads</u><sup>3</sup> on the fringes of the academy. The prominent imagineer, Vexis Harsir, has made a great deal of the <u>fixed-point cube</u><sup>4</sup> that has been slowly scarring a line across the ocean floor of the Missing Sea. This, in turn, has been vehemently opposed by the dysthetician Johannes Chezmen, whose pet theory explains both the Missing Sea and <u>qualified spontaneous evaporation</u><sup>5</sup> in terms of partial differential equations that define planar slices through the possibility space of <u>divine assemblies</u><sup>6</sup>.</p>
<p>The exact reasoning involved in this debate is worthy of the attention of the regular academy. On Harsir's account, the cubes are not <i>descriptive</i> fixed points, but rather <i>prescriptive</i> fixed points. The Missing Sea, then, exists because the cube has an "internal land-sea configuration pattern" that does not match the elevation of the Iurezzan tectonic place, leading to the cube defining a land boundary below sea level. Chezmen's theory, which would take an article unto itself to explain, seeks to one-up Harsir's theory by making the cubes <i>explananda</i> rather than the <i>explanans</i> of the Missing Sea. Fixed-point cubes are too geometrical, he argues, to account for the <i>organic</i> shape of the edge of the Sea where the water abruptly stops. Moreover, the Missing Sea cannot simply be a division between land and water mediated by a continental land-sea regulator, because aquatic animals, despite the complete absence of water, are still able to swim through the Missing Sea. This phenomenon, Chezmen insists, can only be due to divine intervention; hence the differential equations. The literature on both sides is quite deep, and a review of it may break some new ground on the topic in the regular academy.</p>
<p>Neither Harsir nor Chezmen, for some reason, make any reference to <u>Zor Olo</u><sup>7</sup> in their theories, which is a major weakness given the moon's place in the genesis of the Missing Sea. Chezmen makes an offhand reference to divine assemblies targeted at heavenly bodies during a discussion  of <u>Selesteine</u><sup>8</sup> mythology, which some of his peers have taken to imply that the divine assemblies picked out by the equations of the Missing Sea are those targeted to Zor Olo. Chezmen has yet to respond to this through anything other than interpretive dance.</p>

It makes me wonder how those reactions compare to those of the victims of the <b>National Academy of <u>Velskyavo</u><sup>1</sup></b>, where a failing grade is literally a death sentence.</p></div>
<p>The scholars of the National Academy of Velskayavo are, I confess, a rather ruthless breed.  Their all-encompassing educational system (more on that in a moment) allows only the top thirty percent of a class to matriculate, while the bottom twenty percent are demoted.  Not all of those demoted will actually make it to the lower class, of course, as many of them will be executed.  Such high stakes on their academic outcomes mean that competition among students can become literally cutthroat at times.  I have occasionally found it necessary at international research conferences to gently remind visiting Velskyavan professors that they are not permitted to assassinate fellow conference-goers to claim their presentation slots.  As you can imagine, given such a culture, it is no surprise that the National Academy of Velskyavo boasts the second-highest proportion of <u>Pentad academics</u><sup>2</sup> in the world—the highest, of course, being the <u>Stratsky Foundation for Economics and Insurrection</u><sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p>The Academy's culture has greatly influenced the larger culture of Velskyavo, due in large part to their sinister, scheming Department of Education suborning every other branch of government decades ago.  As the years passed, the Education Secretary (who is also Sovereign of Velskyavo) began working academic structures into every facet of society, to the point where every citizen on record has some form of <u>research-related trauma</u><sup>4</sup> and studying consumes 800 billion of the nation's man-hours each year.  The unification of the Education Department and the Justice Department allows courts to assign grades instead of sentences, with the worst grades being reserved to knock criminals out of their current class status.</p>
<p>Though the costs might be high, the effects have been impressive.  Decades of selection pressures have raised the country's education attainment above that of any other country in <i>history</i>, to say nothing of the achievements of their graduates.  There is some controversy over whether to include <u>Marvin Fitch</u><sup>5</sup> among this number, as on the one hand, they awarded him degrees in both Thanatology and Imagineering, but on the other hand, so did everyone else.  The Academy also likely has failed to publish numerous groundbreaking studies of <u>🔇</u><sup>6</sup>, judging by the way tuition seems to keep increasing but no one can say where the money is going.</p>

Its hulking, industrial carapace takes up a full half of the Butterfly Effect Advisory Committee's break room. On Tuesdays, it emits a constant hum that resonates with all of the silverware, making the conference room next to the break room impossible to do any work in on account of the clattering. The user interface is badly designed, and half of the buttons "accidentally" trip safety overrides, making the machine capable of causing serious injury to its operator. A non-negligible percent of the time, it turns the cup into coffee instead of filling it. There's no place to remove the used coffee grounds, but it never runs out of room no matter how much more we keep adding, and some of the Committee members are starting to worry about where it's all going. And yet, it makes the best damn coffee you ever tasted. It's infuriating.</p></div>
<p>Say what you will about the <u>alleged professor</u><sup>1</sup>, and I certainly do, but he was one clever sonnuvabitch. The OPCS is a technological marvel capable of dispensing coffee to any point within a hundred feet through what IT tells us is a wormhole similar to the one created by a <u>Grimer Primer</u><sup>2</sup>. Having warp technology in the break room has been deemed a major workplace safety violation, but none of the office supervisors have been able to get its removal approved, because it's on record as being the property of <u>Placeholden</u><sup>3</sup>, and moving it would require getting the sovereign thereof to sign off on the move. Not that getting the signature would help; the uninstall manual has <u>🔇</u><sup>4</sup> in it.</p>
<p>The Secretor makes some non-coffee beverages, too, but its performance is less consistent doing them. When I figured out where the cream soda menu was, instead of filling the cup I had put into the cup receptacle, it filled all of the cups in the cupboards, then added cream to Gwen's coffee in the next room. While it is technically capable of making hot chocolate, it seems to only recognize toilet bowls as valid containers for it. <u>The Secretary</u><sup>5</sup> loves hot chocolate, so eventually she just started bringing a toilet-shaped novelty mug when she comes by for meetings. Some of the dysfunctions are fairly useful for other purposes, as well: the steamed milk options actually launch seek-and-destroy missiles, which came in handy the one time Cincinatta let a <u>marionette child</u><sup>6</sup> into the Committee wing of the building.</p>

As the military technology of the major oceanic powers increased, the proto-Panarkians shifted from raiding merchants to acting as independent shipping contractors. After the tense Banana Incident, in which Panark nearly came to war with <u>Lepazzia</u><sup>1</sup>, the Panark Fleet declared itself as a sovereign state and sought membership in the Disputatious Assembly. This was initially rejected on the grounds that Panark did not control any land, which prompted Panark to spend the next few years covertly stealing sand, topsoil, and gravel from other countries until they had turned their major carriers each into their own biome. This provoked intense debate in the Assembly as to what kind of land a country needed to control to be recognized. The matter was eventually settled in Panark's favor by pressure from <u>Ulgrav</u><sup>2</sup>, which had begun selling off all of its land and wanted some precedent set to keep its own Assembly seat.</p></div>
<p>Since the advent of computing technology, Panark has become the world's largest provider of computer cycles. Most large-scale computing is done in massive server clusters stored in the depths of Panarkian carriers, which use the ocean as an unlimited heatsink. This has drawn the ire of the Hegemony of Whales for its effect on ocean currents, resulting in a status quo where the Panark Fleet is constantly on the move to avoid the Hegemony's military. The Fleet took this as a provocation to stop paying their Whale Tariffs, which has only worsened relations. Unlike <u>Flandrean</u><sup>3</sup> oil ships, Panarkian cruisers are rarely contracted as tariff-free transport because they cannot move in predictable routes without the Hegemony catching them.</p>
<p>Because of their substantial available computational substrate, the Panark Fleet has the greatest number of <u>computational theologians</u><sup>4</sup> per capita, and most of the non-carrier ships are run essentially as techno-monasteries. The technomonks of Panark are widely regarded for their charitable acts and unmercenary IT work. Their critical role in engineering the systems that allow the Hegemon of Whales to attend the Disputatious Assembly in the flesh is responsible for keeping the stormy relations between the two from breaking into open war.</p>
<p>The Fleet is generally opposed to the Disarrangement Act on the grounds that having to take on more land would overburden their ships. Most suspect that a more pressing concern is that carrying out the Act will raise uncomfortable questions as to how and whence Panark obtained the land they currently have.</p>

Assemblies of Gods</p><p>Another reason that <u>the Hegemony of Whales</u><sup>1</sup> isn't too keen to press its case against the Panark Fleet by force is that the Fleet essentially controls the <u>Taurus Research Station</u><sup>2</sup>. When every space-capable country and Kingsland attached their own thrusters to the station, there was no rhyme or reason to where the thrusters were placed. Now turning the Taurus in any direction requires calculations too complicated for anybody but the Fleet to compute, by virtue of their unmatched computational resources. Nominally, the Fleet does the math for the Assembly as a due, but whenever other sovereigns make fun of Panark for having "fake land", they always change the topic to the Taurus, and eventually the others caught their drift.</p>

Taurus Research Station</p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>Pantheons of Kingsland</h2><p>You can learn a lot about a people from what they think their legends say about them.  When it comes to Kingslanders, however, that rule doesn't hold true, mostly because their legends have an unfortunate tendency to slither through the walls at irregular intervals and eat them.  This makes them an interesting edge case for memetosociologists, who use the religious constructs of Kingsland as sort of a control group with which to evaluate the beliefs of other cultures.</p></div>
<p>It is unclear to what extent Kingslander religious beliefs affect the larger questions about whether a god or gods exist, for it is a matter of documented record that Kingsland is home to many paranatural entities not found anywhere else in the world, and the alleged deities worshipped by the Kingslanders might just be bigger fish in the same pond—a sort of supernatural protection racket, if you will.  Certainly some of the cultic deities—<u>Buddy "Literally Made of Snakes" Johnson</u><sup>1</sup>, for example—seem to fit this theory.  But for others, such as Silentus or the Conjoined Abominations, it's ambiguous whether there is some external power that explains the <u>phenomena</u><sup>2</sup> associated with it, or whether these are just ad hoc explanations of naturally-occurring events.</p>
<p>The cults of Kingsland inhabit an ever-shifting political landscape, both because of constant intrigue between different cults, and because parts of Kingsland sometimes move around for no discernible reason.  It is said that the cults can't offer an embrace of friendship without plunging a sacrificial dagger into your back (compare to the similar proverb about the <u>Fractured Cities</u><sup>3</sup>, which holds that every Hierarch's handshake is laced with contact poison).  A given cult might not recognize another cult's deity as legitimate for political reasons.  This means Kingsland properly has <i>multiple</i> pantheons, each comprising the deities of a group of allied cults.</p>
<p>Cultic worship in Kingsland is heavily based on sacrifice and exhortations to the deity to please, please stay the hell away.  Some cults, like the Order of the Ebon Serpent, find their rituals entirely ineffective, often resulting in <u>spillover into other countries</u><sup>4</sup> when a divine rampage fails to recognize national borders.  Other cults find they might as well not have bothered.  Consider the case of Qoph, the Kingslandian cultic deity of inscrutability and becoming a hollow shell of yourself.  Although Qoph's worshippers spoke of a terrible fate should his worship ever cease, the cult died out in AES 722 after a critical mass of cultists became too depressed to attend services, and so far nothing has happened.  Society has progressed, the economy has industrialized, and every measurable statistic of well-being has increased.  Which I suppose only goes to show that you can't take the word of crazed cultists at face value.</p>

<p>So the argument goes like this: everything tends toward unity and interconnectedness.  The more we centralize stuff, the fewer problems we have.  Centralization increases as time goes on.  Therefore, everything's going to turn out okay in the end.  So yeah, that argument?  Bullshit, all of it.  In reality, civilization's been going downhill since the invention of the nation-state.</p>
<p>That invention was called <b>the Partitioning</b>.  When the Partitioning went down, the <u>Guild of Mapmakers</u><sup>2</sup> had just been formed, and they were spreading their tendrils out all over the place to figure out how to represent the world.  And they were trying to deal with this issue of how do you look at the map and know who's in charge of a particular piece of land?  Hospitality culture was big back then—not anymore, of course, because everything goes to shit—and you had to know who you were bringing guest-gifts for. </p>
<p>So the Guild tried writing down the names of the big nations in the general area they were known to control.  This turns out not to work, since national land control ebbs and flows all the time.  So they went "fuck it" and just drew these big lines all over the map.  Bam, now <i>this</i> side is <u>Selestei</u><sup>3</sup> and <i>that</i> side is <u>Ulgrav</u><sup>4</sup>.  Easy peasy.</p>
<p>Problem is, before the Partitioning, no one gave a shit about who owned the land.  They cared about who owned what was <i>on</i> the land.  If you're an ancient Ulgravian horseprince, your main pre-Partition concerns look like this: "We need water.  Who do I kill to secure this river?  Should I have the horde graze on this hill?  How do we get around that <u>ominous floating cube</u><sup>5</sup>?"  But after the Partition, all of a sudden there's this invisible line down the middle of your grazing plains, and if you cross it King Musclebrain the Painfully Loud sends the <u>Grim Weepers</u><sup>6</sup> after you.</p>
<p>I always get pissed off by these soft-skulled armchair theorists who hail the Partitioning as a great thing because it eliminated the constant tribal war.  Tribal wars are small and over concrete, finite things like water.  But after you invent states, it becomes possible to go to war because your fucking Sovereign <u>isn't satisfied with the size of his genitalia</u><sup>7</sup>.  Have you ever <i>met</i> a Sovereign who was secure in their genitalia size?  It was a fucking mistake to let states own land and we should undo the whole thing.</p>

It did not exist until a tense vote in AES 877, when <u>Lepazzia</u><sup>1</sup> found itself the deciding vote for giving majority to a measure it disliked concerning Assembly procedure. Rather than do something so uncharacteristic as vote against a measure she was not in favor of, the Lepazzian sovereign, Sarah the Quick, instead told the Secretary that there was one more vote against that hadn't been counted yet. The Secretary was confused when Sarah gestured to a hastily-written nametag on the seat next to her that read "PLACEHOLDER", but faced with the prospect of trying to argue with the sovereign of Lepazzia, the Secretary simply acceded and announced the failure of the motion. Because the nametag had been badly written, the name of the country was recorded as "Placeholden". Once the measure's failure was in the books, it became impossible to question the existence and legitimacy of this new country without raising the question of whether the procedural measure should have been in force all this time. Moreover, because it was a procedural measure, raising questions about it would raise questions about every proceeding of the Assembly since 877. Given this, nobody has objected to the permanent reservation of the seat next to Lepazzia, and Placeholden has been marked as an abstention in the votes since then.</p></div>
<p>Despite existing only on paper, Placeholden is at war with every other country on the planet. When the original campus of the Disputatious Assembly was built, the primary meeting hall was built next to a courtyard that had been located around an <u>ominous cube</u><sup>2</sup>. However, over the centuries, the cube has gradually drifted towards the meeting hall due to continental drift. In 931, the cube began pressing up against the outer wall, and in 932 the structure gave way during a summer session of the Assembly. Someone suggested sabotage, and the Assembly passed a motion declaring war on whoever was at fault. Because nobody knew who was responsible, the war declaration had "PLACEHOLDER" written in for the name &mdash; much like the first time, in poor handwriting, resulting in the declaration being notarized as a declaration of war against Placeholden. Because Placeholden does not exist, this war was the only world conflict left unsolved by the <u>Massively Parallel Peace Conference</u><sup>3</sup>. <u>The Hegemony</u><sup>4</sup> blamed the failure of the MPPC to end the Placeholden War on <u>Flandrean</u><sup>5</sup> interference.</p>
<p>It is currently in vogue to claim that the <u>Missing Sea</u><sup>6</sup> is actually Placeholden territory, but this suggestion is not taken seriously, despite my best efforts, and has yet to rise to the level of being officially addressed the Assembly.</p>

Should I tell you of the heroic lengths to which he went for the sake of his students? Of the nights he spent poring over the bleeding edge of psychological research to formulate his <u>unique style of teaching</u><sup>1</sup>? Of the long and dangerous voyages he made around the world to collect specimens for his art? Of the eye he lost to a Barcuvian laserlily, or the two fingers to a rage-hamster? Surely any familiar with the alleged professor's name knows of such things. Instead, I will tell you of his character.</p></div>
<p>Marvin Fitch was born in AES 930 in <u>Flandre</u><sup>2</sup>, where he grew up an absolute bastard. He graduated with an alleged degree in education from the National University of <u>Incendia</u><sup>3</sup> in 953 through the University's Alleged Scholars Program, which offered faster, cheaper university education without university-sponsored accreditation or ethics courses. He began teaching as an adjunct at the University of Eyesland, where he was sanctioned twice in the fall semester and ultimately fired in the spring after one of his students lost a hand to an exam with a buzzsaw on it. This reoccurred at his next position at the Panark Jungle College the following year, and then again at his <i>next</i> position at his alma mater, where he taught several courses in the ASP. Surprisingly, however, NUI did not fire him, and he remained there as an alleged professor until 960, when <u>the I'll Legislate It, I Swear, Don't Think I Won't Act</u><sup>4</sup> forced him to rethink his career. In revenge, he invented the <u>Omega Point Coffee Secretor</u><sup>5</sup>, which currently resides in the Butterfly Effect Advisory Committee's break room, then went under the radar to teach trade skills.</p>
<p>After Incendia caught on fire in 974, the Incendian Bureau of Inquisition, Igirio Fezz, placed the blame (internally, of course, as Incendia does not officially recognize that anything bad has happened) on graduates from the Alleged Scholars Program, which he alleged had failed to teach its students even of the concept of safety precautions. The President, Iyano Niir, put Marvin Fitch on the top of Incendia's Most Wanted List and sent the military on a global manhunt to track the professor (allegedly) down. Fitch quickly dropped off the map. His whereabouts are currently unknown, though it is likely that he, like many political refugees, is hiding out somewhere in <u>the Panark Fleet</u><sup>6</sup>.</p>

It is a matter of national orthodoxy that while the world is a dangerous and uncertain place, there is nothing that cannot be overcome by the fire burning within the human spirit. Therefore, every day at sunrise, every Selesteine citizen wakes up and yells at the sun. There is often forceful pointing, and if the country is having a holiday, occasionally breaking things. Then everyone has a drink. The national beverage of Selestei is heavybeer, which inexplicably weighs several times more than a normal beer per liquid volume. All Selesteines grow up drinking heavybeer, which accounts why virtually all of them are extraordinarily strong.</p></div>
<p>Despite their aggressive extroversion, or perhaps because of it, Selestei is a very easygoing country when it comes to international politics. In centuries past, the Selestei military was feared, and rightly so. The dreaded <u>Grim Weepers</u><sup>1</sup> once carved a bloody swath across <u>the Fractured Cities</u><sup>2</sup>, fueled in their relentless conquest by the maddening pain of eating only spicy food. Today, however, Selestei tends to play the gentle giant, with its sovereign, King Vincent Daggert, playing the life of the party at Disputatious Assembly afterparties. This gregariousness can sometimes transgress the boundaries of good taste, such as when King Daggert told <u>President Niir</u><sup>3</sup> that he was jealous of Incendia ("MAY MY HEART BURN AS BRIGHT AS YOUR COUNTRY ONE DAY!" were his exact words, if I recall). You could tell Niir was trying his best to maintain his composure for the sake of Incendia's official position on the literal dumpster fire the homeland had become, but you could also see him desperately eyeing the open bar.</p>
<p>Selesteine mythology attributes the nation's hot-blooded fervor to its founding hero, Sels. According to the legends, there were once two suns and two moons, which made it impossible for anybody to get any sleep. Sels, outraged at this, challenged the suns to send down the stronger of the two to fight him. The suns conferred, and the older of the two descended to do battle. The two of them fought for a full lunar month until Sels finally grappled the older sun and ate it. The other sun, afraid of Sels' fearsome power, began running around the world, creating the diurnal cycle. Sels, not one to let an opponent run from a fight, leapt into the heavens to pursue it, where he became the third and largest moon. Selesteines often suggest that the nation should destroy <u>Zor Olo</u><sup>4</sup>, the smallest of the three moons, for being unworthy to share the sky with Sels. So far, nobody is sure whether they're being serious  or deadpan, and Daggert changes the topic whenever someone asks about it.</p>

Zor Olo</p><p>Yelling at the sun is an ancient and venerable tradition in Selestei, but it acquired a tint of patriotism when the country entered the Disputatious Assembly and was asked to register an official national anthem. Thus, at occasions when the national anthem of a sovereign's country is played, when the King of Selestei's turn comes, a band of Selesteines come out and scream into the heavens. This is very popular with crowds, whom the King encourages to join in.</p>

<p></p><p>The Selesteines' indomitable spirit and inability to back down from a challenge has gotten them burned before, particularly by some of the craftier nations (I won't name names).  For example, the <u>Roerbach Incident</u><sup>1</sup> left the entire Selesteine military abroad on a dragon-hunting quest.  I asked King Daggert off the record how he would deal with a modern attempt to trick his military out of position while an invasion tried to take his country.  He just laughed.  "Pity the invaders," he said.  "They would have to face our women."</p>
<p>I confess I'm not familiar with enough military lore to evaluate his strategy, but you certainly can't fault his confidence.</p>

The nation as a whole seems to thrive on finding new approaches to any given problem, regardless of whether or not the problem is of any importance or, indeed, has already been solved.  I'm thinking particularly of Project SpaceGills, a national scientific undertaking that aimed to genetically modify everyone on <u>Taurus Research Station</u><sup>1</sup> "in order that they might breathe the purity of space."  This caused something of an international uproar when Phase 3 of testing involved opening the airlock and letting all the air out so they could be sure the gills were working; tensions increased further when it emerged that no one on the station had ever consented to the genetic modification.  Sadly, this led to the expulsion of all Shastrian personnel from the station, prematurely ending their promising <u>space persuasion</u><sup>2</sup> project.</p></div>
<p>Shastrian culture celebrates new and cutting-edge technology, despite the fact that so little of what they produce is actually workable.  Their culture's understanding of itself is that they are more forward-thinking than other nations, a claim they ground by pointing to enormous national research and development costs.  For memetosociologists like my esteemed colleague M. Hon. Milton, however, there is an interesting layer to these claims, as the average citizen has little to do with the national obsession.  At the end of the day, if your toaster doesn't actually work, you'll import a working one from elsewhere.</p>
<p>Thus, Shastrian patriotism is subtly intertwined with an understanding that some person, somewhere else in the country, is actually doing the important work.  The average citizen believes the National University of Shaster is the epicenter of new and exciting technologies, while staff at the University tend to believe the exciting stuff is happening in a different department.  Moreover, an analysis by the <u>Stratsky Foundation for Economics and Insurrection</u><sup>3</sup> found that the research and development money is split between two streams: one that funds research deals with more advanced countries (e.g. <u>the Contagious Republic of Paul Vigotski</u><sup>4</sup>), and one that <u>inexplicably vanishes somewhere in the university</u><sup>5</sup>.</p>
<p>On the political side of things, Shaster enjoys an extremely competent diplomatic staff, which has secured them many alliances and an enviable position in global politics despite a comparative lack of technological or military power to back them up.  Shastrian diplomats were instrumental in resolving the <u>Goats on Boats Affair</u><sup>6</sup> that threatened to plunge the world into conflict.  It is perhaps for this reason that they are able to thrive as a country despite their neighbors being somewhat unruly.  But even more impressive is their ability, as a coastal nation, to maintain tight diplomatic ties with the <u>Panark Fleet</u><sup>7</sup> without harming their relationship with the <u>Hegemony of Whales</u><sup>8</sup>.</p>

If we go down that road, then the technology of choice for doing so is undoubtedly <b>symphonic warp traversal</b>.  First devised by the mad inventor Rime Grimes, SWT is a technological marvel whose foundational principles researchers have yet to uncover.  But the basic theory is simple to explain: an orchestra is positioned in front of an acoustic capture device, which then feeds the sound into what Grimes called a "Grimer Primer," which communicates that information to an engine.  Scientists have discovered it is possible but rarely wise to deviate from Grimes's engine design, even though it is admittedly alarming to rely on a lightspeed engine composed entirely out of cardboard, duct tape, and rubber bands.</p></div>
<p>Researchers have found much greater success by varying the kind of music that is played into the Grimer Primer.  While Grimes's notes insist that classical music is "THE way to go, my chummy chums," early warp experiments ran into materiel problems because most governments refused to risk the national symphonic orchestra in a perilous space experiment.  This reluctance stalled warp research for several years until researchers from Katskria (one of of the <u>Very Definitely Independent States</u><sup>1</sup>) hired a <u>neoclassical metal band</u><sup>2</sup>, which was deemed sufficiently expendable that the experiments could continue.  Since then, warp researchers have tried many genres, discovering that the quality of warp travel is tied to qualities of the music played:</p>
<p>• Classical music typically makes for the smoothest ride, although smooth jazz tends to do better at this</p>
<p>• Rock or metal lend themselves to faster, if bumpier, travel</p>
<p>• Punk rock has the unnerving propensity to send the ship in the wrong direction entirely</p>
<p>• The one recorded use of dubstep in a symphonic warp traversal device destroyed the ship entirely</p>
<p>In addition to the pre-existing genres, <u>Vigotskian</u><sup>3</sup> researchers aboard <u>Taurus Research Station</u><sup>4</sup> are reportedly in the process of developing a new genre of music, "warp trance," specifically suited for warp travel.  It is certain to be a harrowing process, and I am sure we all wish them well.</p>
<p>One concluding note: many lay people are afraid that warp travel might lead to the destruction of the Earth, reasoning that a spaceship travelling at faster-than-light speeds is essentially a massive bullet that could shatter the planet.  I just did the math, and I have concluded that they are absolutely right, and we should all fear for our lives.  But life is so busy and we all have so much to do, so I recommend limiting your stupefying terror to no more than fifteen minutes per day.</p>

Do you know where they got that idea?  From <u>Ulgrav</u><sup>1</sup>.  There's a paper from one of our researchers a year or two before the VDIS experiments where the author (don't remember the name, fuck i'm drunk) suggests trying different genres of music to see what happens.

Don't let the name fool you—the only research they're doing up there is how much toxic waste they can shove into their weapons systems before the gravitational stabilizers break and the whole fucking mess disintegrates into a radioactive cloud of poison in our atmosphere.</p></div>
<p>The Taurus Research Station <i>used</i> to be an actual research station back in the 40's and 50's, but then along came <u>General Kade "Ripper" Gorson</u><sup>1</sup> and the Flandrean military.  Asshole got up in front of the Disputatious Assembly and gave a big speech about how we're probably less advanced than aliens, so we need guns in space to shoot any aliens that come to get us.  I guess military goons stealing your base is just the price you pay for trying to do some science in an out-of-the-way corner of the world.  </p>
<p>Anyways, the last decent publication out of the TRS was Gadner's paper on <u>space persuasion</u><sup>2</sup> back in '78.  It could have been groundbreaking, but that was about when DAS Command made the station off-limits to everyone with civilian-level security clearance, so I guess we're back to square one until I can convince Milton to sociologize himself more security clearance.</p>
<p>Oh well, I guess we have to talk about the military side of things.  Technically, everything in space is falling, which is probably why everything about the Taurus Research Station has been going downhill.  During the 60's, all the DAS member nations brought their own weapons projects up to space and then nailed them piecemeal to the station.  That immediately caused a new problem, which was that the station's thrusters weren't rated for that kind of mass, meaning it started to sink back into the atmosphere.  </p>
<p>The goons did the math and realized it was going to come down over the ocean, which pissed off the <u>whales</u><sup>3</sup>.  Since the whole mess was Gorson's idea, the Hegemon argued it was a Flandrean conspiracy, despite the fact that the world is like 70% ocean and the affected area from the falling station is basically guaranteed to hit water <i>somewhere.</i>  Blubbery fuckers.  Anyways, that led to a round of everyone nailing their nationally-branded thrusters to the TRS, which in turn led to the realization that the station could maneuver itself around and point all those shiny new weapons at the planet.  The DAS was gonna order everyone off, but then someone pointed out that they all had space shuttles, so now the compromise is that everyone keeps a few soldiers up there to watch everyone else's soldiers.  Gee, that seems like a stable situation.</p>

The days are long, the light thin, the weather <u>irrational</u><sup>1</sup>, and the coast <u>inexplicably dry</u><sup>2</sup>; <u>living gods</u><sup>3</sup> walk, or possibly <u>drive</u><sup>4</sup>, the streets, and <u>dead mortals</u><sup>5</sup> roam the hills.  As such, it is little surprise that Kingslanders have such an affinity for the unknown and the ethereal.  If a transparent membrane cursed you out telepathically in Hantu and then dissolved the back wall of your apartment over the course of eleven hours before floating off without so much as a goodbye, is it really that much more outlandish when the hooded cultist on the nearest street corner demands your belief in Grislegrinder, the cosmic intestine-tentacled abomination who devours all upon death?</p></div>
<p>Belief in the Tesseraction is considered by scholars to have begun with the proselytizing of Yphydryx Shadowhand, whose cult rose to prominence in AES 380 before dissolving upon his death in AES 384.  However, in that mere handful of years, the Cult of the Shadowhand spread across nearly all of Kingsland.  Central in their thought was the idea of the Tesseraction: a mythical upcoming point in time wherein our world would burst from its three-dimensional shackles and partake in higher orders of being.  The popularity of the cult is rather easy to explain: Shadowhand taught that the abominations that plague Kingsland draw their power from other planes of existence, and if humans were able to access those planes as well, then they would be able to fight against the horrors on an even footing.  Once his control of the city was cemented, Shadowhand predicted that the Tesseraction would arrive in the late summer of the next year, when <u>Zor Olo</u><sup>6</sup> reached its peak.  According to historical sources, mood in the city was uncharacteristically high, and some poor fools even threw together premature hunting bands before vanishing forever into the city's dark alleys.</p>
<p>On the eve of the predicted Tesseraction, cultists all over the city prepared celebratory pre-ascension meals and readied their best weapons for what they believed was the upcoming slaughter.  But the next day, nothing happened.  Another group of cultists joined the first wave of victims in the alleys, figuring they'd somehow ascended despite not feeling different.  The rest, however, waited in mounting horror until Shadowhand said he got the year wrong and the Tesseraction was actually next year.  Come the next year, people made the celebratory dinners and gathered their weapons again—and were once again disappointed.  This cycle continued until Shadowhand <u>partially disappeared</u><sup>7</sup>.</p>
<p>Up to the present day, Kingslanders continue to celebrate <b>Tesseraction Eve</b> by making fine meals and letting their children play with (usually) toy weapons.  But in modern times the holiday has more of a last-meal-before-execution kind of atmosphere, as Kingslanders have collectively resigned themselves to the fact that nothing can save them from the horrors.</p>

They say of themselves that they took to the sky to embrace the flame of adventure, but scholarly consensus is that they were actually just <u>fleeing the passive-aggression of neighboring Lepazzia</u><sup>1</sup>.  (If possible, don't let Dr. Hanson see this.)</p></div>
<p>Ulgrav's role in contemporary geopolitics is a somewhat precarious one.  The sky has precious few resources beyond sunlight, water vapor, and the occasional bird.  Consequently, Ulgrav is entirely dependent upon their trade allies (primarily <u>Flandre</u><sup>2</sup> and <u>the Compass Republic</u><sup>3</sup>) for essentials like oil and raw materials.  At the same time, their control of airspace is nearly absolute.  The last country to challenge them directly was the Theocracy of Rime in AES 947, and nearly fifty years later they're still a collection of subsistence farmers after <u>what the Ulgravians did to them</u><sup>4</sup>.  So of course no country <i>really</i> feels safe when zeppelins are in their airspace, but no one wants to make a fuss of it either.</p>
<p>The unique situation of the Ulgravian Diaspora has also put them in a complicated position with respect to the Disarrangement Act.  Years of being cramped up on zeppelins and feeling like their homeland was taken from them has pushed the diaspora's general mood into bitterness and resentment.  Indeed, in meetings of the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns, the Ulgravian Sovereign can't help but let some of that bitterness slip inner his own manner.  So Ulgrav desperately wants the Act to pass so that they can get, in the words of my esteemed colleague Dr. Hanson, "some fucking land."  At the same time, the continued existence of their zeppelin fleet depends on oil trade with Flandre, which is highly motivated to prevent the Act from passing.  Even a brief review of the historical record will suffice to communicate that Flandre is, bar none, the worst country on the planet to double-cross.  Thus, Ulgrav has wisely chosen to speak against the Act for the time being.</p>
<p>Culturally, the Ulgravians are of course known for their barely repressed rage, but they also possess strong communal values.  This is likely a result of selection pressures, as anyone found guilty of egregious acts against the community is typically thrown off the airship.  Cultural critics sometimes observe that this practice is similar to their recreational activity called <u>windstriding</u><sup>5</sup>, wherein someone is thrown off the airship, except with a rope tied around them.  These critics typically suggest that both customs reflect their deep-seated need to escape their exile and return to their homeland.  However, as a memetosociologist, I would note that these critics are usually Ulgravians, and this analysis just serves to reinforce the country's standard propaganda line.  I would further note that there is really not that much to do onboard an airship, and they are probably all just bored.</p>

Knowing you're in the crosshairs of the most paranoid nation on the planet is a good motivator to try your luck in other directions.</p>

<p>As far as "other directions" are concerned, I happen to know that the Sovereign received a diplomatic party from the <u>germs</u><sup>1</sup> the other week.

We're nominally allied with the Fleet, but one reason to pick the Vigotskians over the Fleet is if you're trying to look for alternate energy sources—the boatfuckers oppose the Act and they're mortal enemies with the <u>Hegemony</u><sup>3</sup>, so they've never had as much of an incentive to pursue that line of research.</p>
<p>If the Sovereign can land some kind of research deal and reduce our dependence on Flandrean oil, we might see some changes in the alliance.  At the very least, it'll be less of a headlock for us.</p>

Founded by Wren Felsdottor two hundred years before the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns, the Venerable Cartographers did pretty much what you would expect from the name.  The Guild filled a pressing and necessary function, as it was a time of ambiguity and conflict which thankfully de-escalated after the <u>invention of national borders</u><sup>1</sup> six years after the Guild was established.</p></div>
<p>Guilds were both influential and plentiful in those days, which meant individuals were incentivized to try and corner some niche section of the job market by founding their own Guild.  This resulted in, for example, a Guild of Blacksmithing While Reciting Edifying Poetry and a Guild of Stealing Other Guilds' Signs.  You may think I am exaggerating here, but I am not.  Both of these organizations are mentioned in historical records.  Needless to say that none of these Guilds persisted, with the notable exceptions of the <u>Guild of Florists</u><sup>2</sup> and, of course, the Mapmakers' Guild.</p>
<p>But the historical import of the Venerable Society of Cartographers lies, not in the maps they drew of the world—though these were certainly important, and many have survived into the present day—but in the ways they began altering the world to fit their maps.  If memory serves, the initial precedent for this surprising course of action originated with Guildmaster Yithros the Exact, who modern scholars think likely suffered from some kind of obsessive-compulsive disorder.  As the story goes, Yithros was commissioned by the king of Thegul to produce a map of his country for their centennial, which Yithros did with characteristic exactitude.  However, someone jostled his writing arm while he was finishing the curve of the coast.  Such an error was unacceptable to him, so he journeyed out to Thegul and began shoveling away at the coast in order to make it fit his map.  Thegul, however, was entirely below sea level, relying on a complicated system of dykes to keep the ocean out.  Yithros's <i>a posteriori</i> correction flooded the entire country.  And so, the Guild histories tell us, Yithros travelled back to the Guild and changed his map to read "Thegul<i>f of Tan</i>."</p>
<p>Yithros's successors took increasing liberties with their maps.  Where before the Guild's mission had been purely descriptive, prescriptivist mapmaking began, inch by inch, to creep into their business model.  Naturally this was a concern for many Sovereigns, such as when <u>Lepazzia</u><sup>3</sup> ordered a map of the <u>Fractured Cities</u><sup>4</sup> with most of the territory covered by a compass rose.  To keep up with the increasingly geopolitical nature of their duties, the Venerable Cartographers began militarizing themselves to a level that would allow them to challenge nation-states.  The training and materiel required are, of course, a tremendous expenditure, and thus the Venerable Cartographers have abandoned mapmaking over the past few centuries, essentially becoming a top-tier paramilitary organization.</p>

<p>1. The Roerbach Incident</p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>The Very Definitely Independent States</h2><p><b>The Very Definitely Independent States</b> are the most visible embarrassment to the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns' global mandate. After the admittance of <u>the Hegemony of Whales</u><sup>1</sup> into the Assembly revealed a thousand-year-old loophole in the charter that gave the Hegemony a third of the votes in the Assembly, the former Union of Benric States, the country that covered the entire continent of Benri, was suddenly plunged into the Benric Civil War &mdash; named so not because it was a war within a single state, but because it was civil: there were zero deaths and only twenty injured across the entire continent, and none of them were combat injuries. After this sham of a civil war, half of the federal government of the UBS "collapsed" (read: retired with severance pay), and each of the constituent states' governors applied for admittance into the Assembly, insistent on their independence from each other. The other half of the federal government rebranded itself as the Camaraderie Committee of Benri and took the official stance that it was an <i>inter</i>national orgnaization dedicated to advising the newly formed and very definitely independent states of Benri. The first "non-binding recommendation" of the Committee to the Independent States &mdash; which was accepted without question by every State &mdash; was the creation of <u>the Yggdrasil Project</u><sup>2</sup>, ensuring the support of the ascendant Hegemony.</p></div>
<p>To the credit of the Very Definitely Independent States, the States do not always vote in accordance with the Committee's "recommendations", and these differences are even sometimes plausibly because of the differing interests of the States. But these VDIS splits are seemingly always proportioned to the degree of support the Committee has for a measure. Whenever the Committee has no recommendation or recommends abstention, the States somehow manage to always end up splitting their votes 50-50.</p>
<p>This state of affairs is tolerated by the rest of the Assembly, but at a diplomatic cost to the VDIS; generally, the States find it hard to advance their common interests in the Assembly beyond the immediate power they have as a voting bloc, and consequently they remain closely allied to the Hegemony to safeguard their international (and Assembly-procedural) interests. The limits of this tolerance were tested in 961, when Illithor claimed that the <u>Don't Think I Won't Act</u><sup>3</sup> had caused a civil war and it had to split into three independent countries. On the suggestion of the Flandrean <u>General "Ripper" Gorson</u><sup>4</sup>, The Assembly, minus the Hegemony, unanimously voted to send an occupying force to restore peace to the war-torn nation. The governor of Illithor then immediately announced that a legal team had solved the problem and ended the civil war. Occasionally, a sovereign will motion to have international forces unify some of the Independent States, but the States involved invariably claim that an ethnic war has just broken out and reunification is inadvisable.</p>

Most of the world had a chance to experience this in AES 688, when Selestei waged the <b>War of Durun's Ass</b>. During the first session of the year of the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns, President Durun of <u>The Union of Benric States</u><sup>2</sup> spilled his eggnog on King Gristleton of Selestei. Gristleton became enraged and told Durun that he was going to "kick [his] ass". Durun responded that he had a busy schedule, but that if he wanted to come to Benri in the summer and kick his ass then, he was welcome to visit. Gristleton ominously accepted the offer and left to the bathroom to wipe the eggnog off. After he had left, everyone in the room simultaneously realized what was about to happen. When Gristleton failed to return to the Assembly at the end of the recess, everyone between Selestei and the Union scrambled to contact their defense ministries, which was pretty much all of them, because Selestei and Benri are on opposite sides of the planet.</p></div>
<p>Selestei marched into <u>the Fractured Cities</u><sup>3</sup> at the beginning of the following week, fully armed and angry. For one of the only times in recorded history, in the face of the foreign threat on their borders, the Fractured Cities banded together as one to defend their homeland. They were immediately crushed by the Selesteine army. Pausing only long enough to arm-wrestle the survivors and carry off food and barrels of beer, the invading force simply marched straight through to the Shastrian border. In the face of the foreign threat on <i>their</i> borders, <u>Shaster</u><sup>4</sup> rallied its forces to defend its homeland. They, too, were immediately crushed by the Selesteine army. Seizing all of the ships in the harbor, the rampaging mob set sail for Benri &mdash; in the wrong direction. It would take travelling several months and conquering many more countries, including every single country on <u>the Careless Continent</u><sup>5</sup>, before Selestei stood upon the beaches of Benri.</p>
<p>Durun, of course, had heard of Selestei's path of devastation on the way to meet him, and was terrified. His advisers, fearing for the worst should the Selesteines beat a roundabout trail of mayhem on their way to the capital, kidnapped Durun and delivered him to King Gristleton the following day. When the two sovereigns finally stood face to face once again, Gristleton pointed out that Durun had invited him there, and then promptly, in the words of the contemporary historian <u>Pentex Lannogaster</u><sup>6</sup>, "beat the shit out of him". The Selesteines then returned home, and at the following Assembly session King Gristleton acted like the whole thing had never happened.</p>
<p>President Durun would later blame this all on Gristleton, who, he insisted, had bumped his arm when he was holding the eggnog.</p>

This would prove to be one of the formative moments for the young country, forcing them to band closer together for mutual aid to prevent a catastrophe of the same magnitude from reoccurring. Even today, the aftereffects of the War are visible in the chilly bilateral relations between the Fleet and Selestei.</p>

You can tell he's clearly never been out there, because that description is so fucking wrong—well, okay, technically all those things happen but <i>that's not the fucking point</i>, okay?  If you wanna know what windstriding is, go catch a ride on the next Ulgrav ship that resupplies in your area, find one of the tourist-friendly companies, and go punch the clouds with your face.  Pick <u>Yasser's Yells</u><sup>2</sup> if you can.  Ask for Ricardo.  Tell him I sent you.  I get a coupon for every new person I refer.  The <u>Secretary of the DAS</u><sup>3</sup> even recommends it!</p></div>
<p>Again, you're not really going to get it unless you're just <i>out there</i> freezing your ass off and having the time of your life.  But I'll try to translate it for you ground-bound dunderheads.  First of all, you have to realize that the sky has always been important to the Ulgravians.  Ancient Ulgrav was less a state than the territory of several nomadic warrior tribes.  The plains were our home, and we liked the sky because it was a lot like the plains but with fewer enemies.  "Cloud" in Ulgravian is literally translated "Rising dust from the hooves of warrior mounts," and that might seem like a mouthful but in Ulgrav there's a single word for it.  Long story short, when we packed up and left because of <u>those passive-aggressive snot-worms</u><sup>4</sup>, there was only one place we could go that was true to our roots: up.</p>
<p>Second thing, there's an old Ulgravian sport where you'd take an enemy's shield (unless you'd just fought the <u>Grim Weepers</u><sup>5</sup>, who never used shields, in which case you'd use one of their broadswords instead), tie it to your horse, and then let it gallop off.  You'd be standing on the shield (or sword), of course, so you'd have to pull yourself up the rope onto your galloping horse.  Good clean family fun, except all those times when people slipped and dashed their head open on a passing rock or something.  Whatever, it was harder to traumatize kids back then.  Anyways, you're a warrior tribe with a horse-based sport and you don't have horses but you <i>do</i> have one sweet-ass zeppelin, so what do you do?  Obviously, tie the shield to the airship and then jump off and let the airship gallop.</p>
<p>Then, after everyone who tried it that way plummeted to their deaths, they adapted it so that the rope was tied to the <i>person</i>.  Some groups'll still do it with the shield, and there's a subfaction that claims windstriding is all about surfing the shield on the air currents.  Don't listen to them, they're goatfuckers with no sense of history and none of their children will survive the winter.</p>

Taking inspiration from research into memory recall during times of crisis, Fitch subjected his students to a continuous series of crises while he lectured. These crises, chosen to induce fight-or-flight responses, included such educational experiences as filling the room with Barcuvian carnivorous rage-hamsters, dropping the floor from the lecture hall and suspending the desks from oiled ropes, and assigning students to do group work with a <u>marionette child</u><sup>2</sup>. Students who performed poorly in Fitch's classes were especially subjected to this, since the theory of X-treme lecturing dictated that their performance would improve if they were subjected to even more stressful crises. Because these students were predictably picked off by this "attention", Fitch's methods went unnoticed or ignored by university administrators, who only saw Fitch's high rates of student success: an artifact of the bottom half of the bell curve falling off, so to speak.</p></div>
<p>X-treme lecturing was incidentally outlawed in AES 960 by the passing of <u>the I'll Legislate It, I Swear, Don't Think I Won't Act</u><sup>3</sup>, due to a clause that banned pedagogy involving hyphens. This, of course, was no obstacle to the indomitable Marvin Fitch, who switched careers to adult trade education. His practice of this technique continued and was taken up by disciples, which is generally agreed by sociologists to be the cause of the cold, dead, hollow thousand-yard stare electricians and plumbers tend to have in their eyes these days.</p>
<p>Despite its comparably low survival rate compared to most other pedagogical methods, X-treme lecturing boasts an impressive resume of alumni. Several seated members of the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns took at least one X-treme class with Fitch. The bond these alumni share is one stronger than any familial or institutional ties: the bond of shared trauma. One need only witness the knowing look that passes between two graduates of Fitch's in between the spasmodic twitching to know that something was understood there that the rest of us, for better or for worse, will never have access.</p>
<p>Conspiracy theorists regularly claim that Fitch's methods have been adopted by this or that government, or by the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns itself, as a means of re-educating political prisoners. These claims are rarely taken seriously, as Fitch has personally denied that X-treme 
lecturing is useful for education.</p>

The I'll Legislate It, I Swear, Don't Think I Won't Act</p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>Yasser's Yells</h2><p>Let me begin by saying that I am still not entirely sure why we have an article about <b>Yasser's Yells</b> in this report.  Dr. Hanson assured me that one was necessary, however, and since this is in fact the Butterfly Effect Advisory Committee, there is truly no telling what information might turn out to be important in the future.</p></div>
<p>Allow me some minor pontification, if you would, while we're on that point.  The function of a Butterfly Effect Advisory Committee is to guard against so-called "dark horse" outcomes—that is, outcomes not seriously considered when preparing for the future.  If a body, like our own august Assembly, fails to consider a 1% chance of catastrophic failure, then should that slim thread of possibility come to pass, it will do so without any safeguards.  I like to think that the function of this Committee is to remain but a minor footnote in the workings of the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns and ensure that nothing ever comes to pass that would cause us to rise into prominence.  Ours is vital work.</p>
<p>With all of that said, I cannot possibly imagine what dark horse global catastrophe might arise from an independently-owned recreational <u>windstriding</u><sup>1</sup> company on the fringe of the <u>Ulgravian</u><sup>2</sup> zeppelin fleet.  Still, as mentioned above, Dr. Hanson told me she knows the owner and thinks it's a necessary addition to this report.  A good Chairman trusts in the ability of those under his wing, of course, and so I set out to do my due diligence.</p>
<p>After doing my research, I must conclude that it seems like there could very well be something going on with Yasser's Yells.  For example, I heard <u>Secretary</u><sup>3</sup> recommend it while she was standing in our break room.  Why, one wonders, would the Secretary of the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns know of a small country in a nation she's only visited twice?  Suspicious alignments of that sort always suggest a <u>likely candidate</u><sup>4</sup>, but when I reached out through the usual channels I couldn't find any evidence of botanical business dealings whatsoever.  My next thought was that the <u>Botherhood</u><sup>5</sup> might be involved—which hypothesis is the most probable to my mind, given that when the appropriate contacts investigated, they told me that it was as if the Botherhood had never meddled in Yasser's Yells whatsoever!</p>
<p>In the interest of full disclosure, I intend to patronize this establishment after the report ships out.  Dr. Hanson's reviews were quite favorable, and there is still some life in these old bones yet!</p>

<p></p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>The Yggdrasil Project</h2><p>The <b>Yggdrasil Project</b> was an ambitious biotechnical research project spearheaded by an international collaboration between the <u>Very Definitely Independent States</u><sup>1</sup>, the <u>Hegemony of Whales</u><sup>2</sup>, and <u>Shaster</u><sup>3</sup>.  The project began life as an idle side project of <u>the inimitable Dr. Stafford</u><sup>4</sup> during a guest teaching stint at the <u>National Academy of Velskyavo</u><sup>5</sup>, which goes a ways toward explaining the project's success in the face of Shastrian involvement.</p></div>
<p>The basic idea of the project was to create a new form of life that could cleanse the oceans of centuries of industrial pollution.  Dr. Stafford's notes suggested taking advantage of the distinctive properties of the oceanic environment; thus, it was decided some kind of plant would work best.  The final shape of the organism evolved over the course of the project; while it was initially modeled after kelp, the nascent Yggdrasil organism soon began to take after terrestrial trees in shape.</p>
<p>It is appropriate at this point to note that the various participants had different objectives for the project.  Shaster's motives, as ever where Dr. Stafford is concerned, are entirely transparent: they've never missed a chance to be involved with one of his projects.  As such, their involvement was mostly nominal.  The Very Definitely Independent States, on the other hand, had more than the glory of a Stafford project at stake: a successful collaboration with the Hegemony would cement their position on the international stage.  But that motivator proved to be the project's undoing.</p>
<p>As the project progressed, the Hegemony of Whales began to push for an additional project goal: the ability to control Hegemony territory.  <u>Flandre</u><sup>6</sup> had always been a thorn in the Hegemony's side, especially given their flaunting the recently instituted Whale Tariffs, and of course they'd never been on the best of terms with the <u>Panark Fleet</u><sup>7</sup>.  To appease the cetacean pressure, the other actors on the project quickly moved to appease them.  Thus, in addition to filtering out toxins from the water, the organism was also given prehensile tentacles strong enough to drag a boat below the surface.</p>
<p>After years of development, the Yggdrasil Project was declared complete in 939, after which they hired the <u>Esoteric Order of Florists</u><sup>8</sup> to plant them all over the world.  But no sooner had Hegemon Aouwouou unveiled the first fully-grown forest of <u>Ravenous Squid-Trees</u><sup>9</sup> on live television did they seize and devour her before disbelieving witnesses.  Reeling in shock, the Hegemony did the only thing they could, and blamed Flandre.</p>

But you don't care about that.  You're reading this article to find out why there's a giant fucking smiley face in the night sky, leering at you and scaring the snotty little bipedal consumerism batteries you call children.</p></div>
<p>First off, <u>researchers</u><sup>1</sup> are pretty sure that the moon didn't start out that way.  (Like, duh, it's a fucking ball of rock.  Smiley faces aren't natural fucking phenomena.)  The historical record puts it as one of the main inciting events for the <u>Roerbach Incident</u><sup>2</sup>.  So really the big puzzle is how it got that way.  How'd someone fuck up a moon eight hundred years before anyone made it to space?</p>
<p>Well, there's an easy answer and a hard answer.  The easy answer is we don't really know <i>how</i> it was done, so we probably don't have to worry about the same thing happening to one of the other moons, or to the planet.  Besides, it's been a long time, so we're probably done with that sort of thing happening again, right?  Yeah, well, <i>easy answers are for cowards</i>.</p>
<p>The hard answer is that we do know <i>why</i> it happened: fucking <u>Kingsland</u><sup>3</sup>.  ("We" here excludes the whole lot of <u>tumor-brained sea cows</u><sup>4</sup> who blame <u>Flandre</u><sup>5</sup>.)  Shoulda been obvious in hindsight, really.  Like, their whole fucking shtick is "oh no, the stars are right, we're all doomed!"  And I get that y'all wanna just laugh the whole thing off, cuz when has an ancient Kingslander deity ever shown up and fucked up <i>your</i> front lawn?  </p>
<p>Well, it happened.  Apparently some kinda eldritch thingy showed up and they managed to seal it in the moon.  That's what caused the giant smily cracks.  It also <u>fucked up the ocean</u><sup>6</sup> despite the fact that <u>tides don't work that way</u><sup>7</sup>.</p>
<p>So here's the thing—your dismissive, I-don't-wanna-worry-about-this-because-it-distracts-me-from-watching-television attitude is <i>ridiculously</i> stupid, because every night the tentacle-prints of some unspeakable horror play voyeur on your pathetic excuse for a sex life.  Just in case you weren't paying attention, we've got ancient Kingslander records saying the holes in the third moon happened because <i>the stars were right for once</i>.  Like, you wanna talk about butterfly effects?  What do you do when the butterfly is some eleventh-dimensional thing that can't eat us because the continents happen to be aligned in the right way?  <i>What the fuck do you think happens when you move them around</i>?</p>

She was demerited with a Doctorate of Misosophy for her achievements in the egregious violation of scholarly norms and remorseless sabotage of her academic opponents, and subsequently recognized by her peers as a dangerous and unhinged maverick when she actually showed up to her misosophy degree conferral. Her work in the field of combat philosophy has been denounced by several major journals of philosophy, and she has the prestigious honor of being the first Pentad academic to receive a restraining order from an official conference of the National Academy of Barcu. Her appointment to the Butterfly Effect Advisory Committee passed by a 3 vote margin and provoked an official letter of protest from the High Exarch Minor of Flandre.</i></p></div>
<p><i>Dr. Rubric enjoys fencing, mountain biking, and the panicked consternation of freshmen. When she is not at the Assembly on Committee business, she lives in her condo in Kingsland South with her pet snake Rufus and something that lives in the walls that she refuses to name, because to name it would be to acknowledge its presence.</i></p>
<p></p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>~Dr. Herbert Jones</h2><p><i>As a young man of eight, <b>Herbert Jones</b> surprised his parents by taking apart the family encyclopedia and rearranging the articles in order of geographic proximity to their Walksford home.  Sixty years and seven academic positions later, he has not lost that early enthusiasm for rearranging humanity's knowledge into shapes that suit us better.</i></p></div>
<p><i>Dr. Jones is a prolific author, having published over thirty volumes of nonfiction, including </i>Where to Put the Shit<i>—an exhaustive treatise on how architects place restrooms when designing buildings—as well as the celebrated trilogy </i>Venereal Diseases of the Great Historians, Vol. I-III.<i>  He also made history by publishing the first fully fictional encyclopedia, </i>The Fairfax Guide to Other Places,<i> which won the Greentemple Award for Creative Fiction in AS 973.</i></p>
<p><i>Dr. Jones's career has been marked by academic success in addition to literary.  After winning a Staff of Mastery from the Yuglandian College of Hysteria's Inventory Department, he pursued a doctorate education at the University of Eyesland.  There he studied Miscellania under the legendary Riggs Behemon, who remained a close friend and mentor until his death in AS 982.  Dr. Jones's doctorate thesis was adapted into the </i>Herbert Jones Encyclopedia of Precarious Legislation.  <i>Dr. Jones would later return to the University of Eyesland to claim the Heinrich Stafford Chair of Arrangement.</i></p>
<p><i>A noted expert in politics, Dr. Jones was chosen to preside over the Butterfly Effect Advisory Committee for the Disarrangement Act in AS 989.</i></p>
<p></p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>~Gwen Hanson, PhD</h2><p><i><b>Dr. Gwen Hanson, PhD</b> is the head of the Entropology Department at the Transient University of Ulgrav, where she has worked for the past eleven years.  She received a Masters degree (with honors) from the University of Hejilad, and completed her doctorate work with the Townsend Foundation with a groundbreaking thesis on why the Botherhood can't possibly get anything done.</i></p></div>
<p><i>Entropology had long been something of a niche academic field until Dr. Hanson brought it into prominence with the popular nonfiction book "Why Everything Goes to Shit" in AS 986.  The work introduced an entry-level understanding of entropology to the general populace, which seemed like a good thing until it, inevitably, went to shit.  Now she can't walk down the street without hearing morons butchering her life's work in casual conversations.  Fuck all of you.</i></p>
<p><i>As an academic and professor, Dr. Hanson has won the respect of both colleagues and students.  She was awarded the Ngote Award for Professorial Excellence in AS 988, a highly coveted decoration given to a professor by majority student vote.  She has successfully defended against no less than four accusations of misosophy, even managing to reflect the humiliation on her accuser in three of those cases.</i></p>
<p><i>Today, she lives with her husband and two children aboard the Ulgravian zeppelin </i>Thunder Bumble<i> until such time as the fucking Sovereign manages to get someone to sell us some fucking land.</i></p>
<p></p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>~Pierce Milton, MHO</h2><p><i>Introductory memetosociology texts will tell you that memetosociologists study the ways in which society's perception of how society works influences the way society actually works.  But <b>Pierce Milton, MHO</b> is one of the few memetosociologists who will tell you that those textbooks are themselves a memetosociological pressure vector that try to shape the way young m-socists try to pursue their discipline.</i></p></div>
<p><i>In AS 983, Honored Milton won acclaim by uncovering the secret insider-only fast-track inside the m-soc program at Stafford College and blackmailing the administration into giving him his degree after only three weeks.  Over the next three months, he successfully negotiated Masters degrees from Kains University and the Royal University of Lepazzia simultaneously, before following up with a PhD from Warbaum's University before the end of the year.  This rise in prominence beat the fastest record for m-soc career path completion, so by the following year the Grand Council of Memetosociologists had awarded him the right to use the honorific above PhD: MHO, or "Most Honored One."</i></p>
<p><i>In recognition of his academic and social engineering achievements, Honored Milton invited himself to the Butterfly Effect Advisory Committee and joined in AS 987.</i></p>
<p></p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>~Remilion Christophy, PhD</h2><p><i><b>Dr. Remilion Christophy, PhD</b> is an independent researcher in the field of sociophysics, which he insists is a legitimate field of study. His seminal work </i>The King Electric: The Influence of Electromagnetic Variance on Order and Revolution<i> is widely considered by sociologists and physicists. He achieved international renown during his presidency over the 988 Butterfly Effect Advisory Committee that advised the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns on the civil unrest in Flandre following the death of the High Exarch. His knack for applying the systems analysis of physical science to the social dynamics of succession came to the fore during the Committee's debate over whether to recommend the annihilation of </i>both<i> sides of the conflict. Though Christophy's peers have found great success in using physical metaphors according his method, he continues to insist that his theories only make sense when interpreted literally. This has yet to catch on.</i></p></div>
<p><i>Dr. Christophy is a voting member of the International Ignitennis Council and boasts an illustrated college career. He spends his free time reading science fiction and occasionally writes for scifi conventions. When he isn't pursuing his sociophysical research, he works as a librarian in Anathema Vale, Flandre, to continue the work of his late wife.</i></p>
<p></p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>~Spheven Kain</h2><p><i><b>Spheven Kain</b> is a former computational anthropologist and current night janitor at the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns. He previously served as a member of the Butterfly Effect Advisory Committee before an unlikely series of what he maintains are coincidences that led to his departure from the Committee and the revocation of his degree. He got his revenge, though, because he used the last of his contacts to get the night janitor gig, and the President of the Committee doesn't lock up the report documents overnight. What do you think of </i>that<i>, you cretins! Thought you could get rid of me that easily?</i></p></div>
<p><i>In the copious amount of spare time he has since his dismissal, Kain has devoted himself to learning new skills, like lockpicking, cryptography, and free climbing. He believes strongly in the benefits of interdisciplinary collaboration, and attests that what he insists is his extended sabbatical has produced several fruitful avenues of computational anthropology research, which he plans to pursue as soon as they give him his degree back. He lives in the janitorial closet of the Disputatious Assembly's committee wing, where he is engaged in an ongoing territorial conflict with the sovereign of Incendia, who lives in the BEA Committee break room.</i></p>
<p></p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>🔇</h2><p>The enigmatic phenomenon designated in print as "🔇", and designated in speech by pausing and gesturing emphatically, is difficult to describe. This is not for lack of trying, as several major universities have faculty who attempt to publish work on it. "Attempt" is the key word here, as all direct descriptions of it are suppressed by forces not currently understood. Despite the fact that it is not, as researchers suspect, a meteorological phenomenon, the most success on studying 🔇 has come from Barcuvian weather analysts. While the flashes of complete darkness and resounding silences of <u>antithunderstorms</u><sup>1</sup> are clearly similar to 🔇, the exact relationship they have has yet to be articulated, for obvious reasons. Despite this seemingly inherent barrier to results, research into it continues to be funded, undoubtedly helped by the inability of university administrators to say what exactly it is they are trying to cut out of the research budget.</p></div>
<p>For what are hopefully equally obvious reasons, this phenomenon is the subject of a great deal of interest from the Kingsland cult of <u>Silentus, the patron deity of some goddamn peace and quiet for once</u><sup>2</sup>. By engaging in a campaign of linguistic activism, the cult has succeeded in hijacking a number of common local idioms to connote or otherwise reference it. Consequently, conversations in which these idioms are used are liable to be suddenly halted by the suppression effect. This has led to widespread sentiment against the cult of Silentus, which, in a grand irony, has led to them being bothered by people making ruckuses more than they were before. The cult, as usual, has yet to make an official statement about this, but it is unclear whether this is because of its patron deity or because being accosted by mutes for linguistic subversion is far from the worst thing that could happen to you in Kingsland.</p>
<p>The motivation to understand 🔇 in the academic community is largely driven by engineers working in the field of <u>symphonic warp traversal</u><sup>3</sup>. The field has yet to fully understand the technology that the mad inventor Rime Grimes left behind, which enabled complex warp calculations to be performed via orchestra, and thus money is thrown at any lead on an ontological link between acoustics and other subfields of physics. This has somewhat tarnished the prestige of warp research in the public eye, as physics departments specializing in warp research find themselves unable to describe where their budget goes.</p>
<p>What is truly remarkable, however, is the significance 🔇 holds for the Disarrangement Act. Because it&mdash;</p>
