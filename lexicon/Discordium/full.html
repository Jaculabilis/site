<div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>986 Bring Your Daughter to Work Day incident</h2><p>Ah, the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns.  I can think of no place on earth that is quite like it.  Nowhere else will you find the heights of power so entangled with the lows of maturity.  A place so orderly, yet filled with the pettiest of bickering—and, yes, bloodshed.  One's mind jumps immediately to the noble warriors representing the <u>Careless Continent</u><sup>1</sup>, of course, but we mustn't forget that eventful day in 973 when <u>Hegemon Muoauwu</u><sup>2</sup> sneezed and accidentally assassinated the Princeps of Saphira, or when <u>Madam Secretary</u><sup>3</sup> beat Queen Hester the Swift of Bolum with a ruler and set off a succession crisis.</p></div>
<p>Another event sees discussion in the same breath: one that I had the honor of witnessing, the <b>986 Bring Your Daughter to Work Day Incident</b>.  Many scholars express a degree of skepticism about the events that took place here on that day, as there was a great deal of confusion and it was not recorded very well.  However, I have always held a special interest in Flandre, and I happened to be sitting with then eight-year-old <u>Seraphi Ironheart</u><sup>4</sup> when she set events in motion.</p>
<p>Bring Your Daughter to Work Day was an event put forward, if memory serves, by Deified Hlisst of Kel (who, mind you, is as mortal as the next Sovereign).  The official reasoning for the measure was an opportunity to humanize political opponents and teach the next generation how things are done in these noble chambers.  Little did they realize the next generation contained Miss Ironheart, and that she had a few lessons to teach <i>them!</i></p>
<p>Her first strike was the use of <u>holographic technology</u><sup>5</sup>—a present for her seventh birthday, she told me—to create a simulacrum of famed Kushrian champion Balam Al-Hasslain.  Al-Hasslain himself was reportedly quite taken with the projection before she told him that it had been created by scientists of the Veluus Republic (now allied with Kush against their mutual neighbor Gheir, but at the time, a mortal enemy).</p>
<p>Her second move was to spread rumors among the warriors of the Careless Continent that their enemies were hidden among the representatives of the <u>Very Definitely Independent States</u><sup>6</sup>, and that projection technology could be detected by way of a geiger counter.  However, she herself was wearing (harmlessly) radioactive clothing, and had made sure to give every VDIS Sovereign a hug earlier that day.  Thus, the Careless Continent contingent seemingly discovered that <i>all</i> of them were disguised foes, and a massacre began.</p>
<p>The Hegemony would later condemn Flandre, but Flandre maintains that Ironheart was acting independently.  Ironheart has gone on record saying that she was never there, and that the events were actually the handiwork of a <u>Botherhood</u><sup>7</sup> operative disguised as her, which should have been obvious once everyone found out she was radioactive.</p>

Noting the use of ritual and repetition within religious devotion, Stafford theorized that religious ritual could be abstracted into an algorithm, which could then be implemented by any universal computer, allowing the ritual to be repeated at hardware speed over every computational core. When this marginal note was discovered, it sparked a flood of research into the algorithmic representation of ritual and the digital representation of symbol, most of which was immediately anathematized. The bulk of these anathemas were lifted in the following decades, allowing the products of its research to be aired openly. Within computational theology, a program whose execution corresponds to the performance of a particular ritual is known as a <i>divine assembly</i>, and the library of divine assemblies that have been written by computational theologians is referred to as the <b>Assemblies of Gods</b>.</p></div>
<p>The Assemblies remained a rather academic affair until the 960s, when <u>Shaster</u><sup>2</sup> was rocked by agitation from <u>misosophers and economists</u><sup>3</sup> who wanted to replace all religious activity in Shaster with divine assembly executions, thus eliminating both the philosophical quandaries of divinity and all bank holidays. The so-called "computational reformers" gained a foothold in the Senate, which allowed them to hang on to relevance for most of the decade until the  untimely death of the movement's leader, Ik Severent, in a shipwreck. His successors, Harry and Isabelle Writsmith, were incompetent to the task of defending the movement to the Senate. Within the year, the country tired of their shenanigans, and banned computational theology outright. A brief resurgence a few years later was quickly quashed when the Senate threatened to have a national university posthumously award Severent a dysthetics degree. The Senate even proposed naming computational theology as a Dark Pentad discipline, though the measure was quietly tabled after <u>the Panark Fleet</u><sup>4</sup>, a bosom ally of Shaster, expressed significant disapproval of the motion.</p>
<p>Most usage of the Assemblies of Gods is done on Panark servers, either by Panark itself or offered as a service to other countries. On most holy days, the Fleet offers complementary cycles to countries to run divine assemblies that correspond to observances for that day. This has become a point of tension with Kingsland, whose <u>complicated religious landscape</u><sup>5</sup> all but ensures that every day is a holy day for at least one Kingslander cult.</p>

Pantheons of Kingsland</p><p>In the wake of the incident in Shaster, the offering of divine assembly executions gradually became normal throughout the 970s. This contributed to a decrease in the number of sectarian conflicts, until a series of investigative journalism reports in 979 uncovered a dark underside to the Assemblies of Gods. Two years earlier, an anonymous Panarkian technomonk of the Desert Fleet (believed by many to be the <u>alleged professor Marvin Fitch</u><sup>1</sup>) had written a series of hymns that, when compiled into a divine assembly, injected various curses into other assemblies running on the same machine. This precipitated a massive scandal for the Panark Fleet, which their sovereign deftly handled by nationalizing the malicious hymn-software, gathering the nation's best programmers to reverse-engineer it, and adding it to their business model. Now sectarians can pay top dollar to Panark's technomonks to have hymns composed to attack their religious enemies' divine assemblies or defend their own against such attacks. As <i>physical</i> sectarian conflicts have continued to decrease, the international community has collectively agreed that this is an acceptable conclusion to the whole affair.</p>

<p>1. Professor (allegedly) Marvin Fitch</p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>Asynchronous energy</h2><p>Invented by the incomparable <u>Dr. Stafford</u><sup>1</sup>, the theory of <b>asynchronous energy</b> extends insights from quantum mechanics into practical applications. These insights had not been made at the time, of course, but it's not like that was ever an obstacle for the High Illuminator. Quantum theory allows for small-scale violations of conservation principles, as long as those violations occur within a small enough timespan. Stafford's innovation was to develop a physics that could make these violations usable on human time scales by having the timespan extend piecemeal across a longer stretch of time; thus, while a violation might only occur for some number of picoseconds, some of those picoseconds might be a minute later than the rest. Managing to pull this off without catastrophe is a testament to Stafford's brilliance.</p></div>
<p>The application of asynchronous energy theory is limited in most cases and usually reduces to regular physics, just with more math. However, the indirection layer of asynchronous energy theory shines in a use case close to home for <u>Flandrean</u><sup>2</sup> northerners like the good doctor: physics in the Barcuvian edgelands. It is a well-known fact that Barcu is different from the rest of the world, in <u>some very odd ways</u><sup>3</sup>. Physics is no exception to this. Practical energy asynchronicity is most profitable in the edgelands where Barcuvian physics gives way to regular physics. By using normally energy-neutral processes, but straddling them across the gradient into Barcuvian physics, energy can be produced nearly limitlessly. Flandre has grown to accept this as sufficiently useful to be worth the decade of National Response Protocols (Supernatural Existential Threat) it engenders. This speaks volumes about the sheer advantage asynchronous energy gives Flandre to be worth such a risk.</p>
<p>Speaking of the risks, nobody is really quite sure what they are, since nobody really understands asynchronous energy theory in the first place. The leading theory is that a Barcuvian straddle-generator produces energy by borrowing it from the near future, then paying off the energy "debt" when the future arrives by borrowing even more future energy. If this is indeed how it works &mdash; and, again, nobody is actually sure &mdash; then there is a mounting energy debt on the Barcuvian border that, if it "defaults", would cause unimaginable damage. The projected effects range from the edgelands dropping to absolute zero to <u>the entire continent</u><sup>4</sup> being converted to mass-energy to be sucked into the past. The implications of this for the Disarrangement Act are unclear, but if Flandre is forced to comply with the Act, it is likely they will attempt to prevent the implosion of their asynchronous infrastructure by declaring swaths of Barcu to be their sovereign territory. This may provoke war between Flandre and the other Barcuvian nations, such as Kingsland or the Barrowlands, and if there's anything good for the international community, it's keeping Flandre off the warpath. The last thing we need is for the <u>High Exarch Minor</u><sup>5</sup> to be thinking seriously about how to conquer the world.</p>

<p>1. High Illuminator Saint Doctor Heinrich Stafford<br>2. Flandre<br>3. Barcuvian antiweather<br>4. Iurezza (continent)<br>5. High Exarch Minor Seraphi Ironheart</p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>Barcuvian antiweather</h2><p>The only thing worse than getting rained on because you forgot your umbrella is getting rained on from underneath your umbrella. Despite this, <b>antiweather</b> remains one of the biggest reasons why it's inexplicable that people still live in the geographical region of Barcu. The ultimate cause of antiweather, and its localization to Barcu, remain unknown, though one favored theory blames it on an ancient and accidental case of <u>space persuasion</u><sup>1</sup>.</p></div>
<p>The most common form of antiweather is <i>uprain</i>, which condenses into droplets deep in the water table, then precipitates up until it breaks through the ground, rising into the sky to become clouds and drenching the underpants of any visitors who forgot their underbrellas. More severe forms of antiweather include <i>antithunderstorms</i>, where bolts of darkness cause sudden periods of silence, and <i>antitornados</i>, wherein air from the upper atmosphere is blown to the surface in a column that pushes away everything near its base. The <i>crepusculum borealis</i> was previously blamed on Kingsland, until archaeologists found evidence that the shadowy curtains that occasionally flit through the region were attested from before Kingsland was founded. The snow in Barcu is hot, but it's still just called snow.</p>
<p>Geologists studying Barcu often invoke antiweather effects to explain Barcu's odd mountainous geography. While some regions of Barcu are relatively flat, like the Barrowlands, the mountainous areas rise up sharply, creating stark boundaries between jagged, rocky slopes and arcadian plains. This happens, it is thought, because while normally mountains are weathered down, in Barcu they are weathered up. The air of mystery this gives Barcuvian mountains makes it a popular location for the theorized headquarters of <u>the Esoteric Order of Florists</u><sup>2</sup> &mdash; a somewhat flawed theory, because the Order has never (been proven to have) given anyone the common Barcuvian Laserlily, and you'd think that they'd make use of such an easily-available resource if they were really based there.</p>
<p>Antiweather is thought by some to be closely related to the <u>electric undead</u><sup>3</sup>, which have been traced back to the Barrowlands. These researchers theorize that both the electric undead and antiweather are sustained by an ancestral curse lying over the Barrowlands. Some fringe theorists further suggest that the Barrowlands' current sovereign, Sornhandr, King Eternal, has been cursed to live on as a revenant, and that this is why the last few sovereigns of the Barrowlands have all had the exact same name and appearance. The mild racism of these suggestions aside, answers have not been forthcoming, since the interns tasked with asking the King Eternal about this tend to receive ancient curses in an old and forgotten tongue instead of answers, and my grad students keep quitting when I <u>suggest they try</u><sup>4</sup>. However, the ancient curses often cause their victims to be struck by lightning, so the connection is plausible.</p>

<p>1. Space persuasion<br>2. The Esoteric Order of Florists<br>3. Electric undead<br>4.

Though, of course, since we don't really know what the Order <i>does</i>, we can't tell what sort of noise they're trying to blend in.</p>

<p></p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>Biosphere fascism</h2><p>Nobody wants to believe we're all screwed.  Meanwhile I'm over here and I study this shit on a professional basis, so I'm constantly hearing uneducated morons tell me how we're not actually screwed.  I'm like "Have you even read <i>Why Everything Goes to Shit?</i>"  And then they go (and it's usually a man between 20 and 40 saying this) "Well, yeah, but the author doesn't consider that his model assumes—" and that's usually when I kick them in the balls.</p></div>
<p>Listen, you self-indulgent horsewives, <i>entropology is built on fucking math</i>.  You don't have to assume anything, you just have to plug the numbers in and see what comes out.  And what comes out is "you're screwed."</p>
<p>One of our sister fields, <b>biosphere fascism</b>, is built around this whole problem.  It used to be "environmental science" back in the day, but the environmental scientists kept running numbers that spelled out "you're screwed" and nobody wanted to believe them.  There were a bunch of attempts to soft-pressure everyone into realizing they were killing the environment, but those went exactly nowhere.  So they scrapped the whole field and replaced it with "biosphere fascism," which was lighter on the environmental science and heavier on making public examples of dissidents.</p>
<p>There were a ridiculous number of environmental problems by the early tenth century, including rising acidity in the oceans (or at least <u>most of them</u><sup>1</sup>), a bunch of species going extinct for a bajillion reasons, and Kingsland.  Some academics will also talk about air pollution, but don't listen to them.  They're racists and they hate zeppelins because they hate their miserable selves.  Anyways, once the <u>Hegemony of Whales</u><sup>2</sup> came into the picture, there were a bunch of treaties meant to ensure ocean pollution wasn't used as a political weapon, but then they went and fucked it up with the <u>Yggdrasil Project</u><sup>3</sup>.  Academia started figuring maybe the government wasn't gonna help.</p>
<p>So the biofascists started taking matters into their own hands.  Biofascist grants funded a number of leftover devices theorized by the peerless <u>Dr. Stafford</u><sup>4</sup> and biofascist activist groups took a leaf out of <u>Queen Buttface the Prick</u><sup>5</sup>'s book and disappeared a couple obstreperous upstarts that no one's gonna miss.  Well, no one important.  Well, I don't.</p>
<p>These days compliance with biofascist orthodoxy is enforced by the <u>Joint University Strike Team for Interdisciplinary Collaboration Enforcement</u><sup>6</sup>.  If you go around denying climate change, they just bust down your door and go "Stop, evildoer!  Come quietly or in pieces!"  And you're like "But I don't believe in scientific evidence!" and they're like "it's peer reviewed, you regressive ball of ignorance" and you're like "I peer reviewed <i>your mom</i>" and they're like "I'll peer review <i>your face</i>" and then they shoot you in the face.  Which is hilarious, but ultimately just another example of everything going to shit, because my oldest daughter is in her edgy phase and I hate monitoring her internet use so that fucking academic hit squads don't come knocking on our door.</p>

Joint University Strike Team for Interdisciplinary Collaboration Enforcement</p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>Bloodmoot</h2><p>I had the good fortune to attend a <b>bloodmoot</b> once, and I consider it a formative experience both as a person and as an academic. I was visiting a conference in <u>the Fractured Cities</u><sup>1</sup> with my <i>dear</i> colleague,  Dr. Julie Mandel, where both of us were presenting papers. My talk was on the subject of my graduate research, the justification of state suppression of academia. Dr. Mendel's talk, which was scheduled right after mine, was supposed to be about the liberating power of education, but she ended up spending the first half giving refutations of my talk. Naturally, this annoyed me, so I invited her to the nearby bloodmoot that was going on that day.</p></div>
<p>Now, the most important thing to know about going to a bloodmoot as a foreigner is that everyone there, with no exception, is out to get someone. A few of those present  are <i>primaries</i>, who have the unenviable task of trying to kill the opposing Hierarch directly. These are your snipers, your poisoners, your stagehands holding up anvils by ropes (tried surprisingly often since <u>Roerbach</u><sup>2</sup>), etc. This task is unenviable because all of the other attendees at the bloodmoot, the <i>secondaries</i>, have the task of either neutralizing the opposing primaries or neutralizing the people trying to neutralize their own primaries. If you're lucky, you'll be so far up the chain of counterplays that nobody is specifically tasked with neutralizing you, which means you only have to fear the free agents looking for any weak points in the opposing counterplayers. When you attend as a foreigner, you naturally present as a free agent, so you're safe as long as you don't appear to be on either Hierarch's side. If you do accidentally show support for one side, it's best to leave the premises immediately before one of the other free agents gets to you.</p>
<p>Dr. Mendel, unfortunately, was wearing a red cardigan, which just so happened to be the color of one of the two Hierarchs meeting at that bloodmoot. I last saw her being stuffed into a box by two orderlies <u>wearing what was possibly red</u><sup>3</sup> and being loaded onto a mail gigatrebuchet. Right before it was fired at one of the Hierarchs, though, <u>The Lunchtime Fallacy</u><sup>4</sup> appeared out of the warp and hit it, diverting the aim, and the payload ended up being <u>fired through the ceiling</u><sup>5</sup>. This must have been according to plan, because one of the Hierarchs started cackling as a flock of <u>marionette children</u><sup>6</sup> descended through the new hole in the ceiling. I took that as my cue to ditch, but I must have made a wrong turn, because I ended up in a hallway with the Hierarchs at one end and the corvid flock on the other. Had to use my spare flashbang to stun the Hierarchs and get to the fire escape ahead of the crows. I was barely able to slam the door shut behind me before they got out.</p>
<p>Anyway, that's how I became, at least on paper, one of the competitors for the throne of the Fractured Cities, which figured prominently in my subsequent <u>misosophy degree</u><sup>7</sup> conferral.</p>

The Dark Pentad</p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>The Book of Schemes</h2><p>The <b><i>Book of Schemes</i></b> is the official anthology of the national mythology of <u>Flandre</u><sup>1</sup> as approved by the Flandrean Council of Exarchs. The myths included within are, of course, only a subset of all of the myths of the Flandrean people, and many various other anthologies may be found that include the so-called deuterocanonical myths. The <i>Book of Schemes</i>, however, is the product of centuries of scholarly work to create an anthology that would most fully and faithfully reflect the national consciousness of Flandre.</p></div>
<p>To this end, its contents have been carefully selected to maximize applicability over important topics of national interest using a lean subset of all Flandrean mythology. Furthering this goal, scholars have spent centuries fitting linguistic ambiguities into the official translations. As the inimitable <u>Dr. Stafford</u><sup>2</sup> observed, this creates not only a common mytho-cultural language by enculturing all Flandreans with the same set of common narratives, but also, by shaping the problems that will be encountered in interpreting the text, a common set of conceptual categories through which the great questions of human culture are approached.</p>
<p>None of this, though, so faithfully captures the Flandrean spirit as the fact that every officially-sanctioned copy of the <i>Book of Schemes</i> is booby-trapped. Despite this (or, more likely, because of this), it is a standard part of the primary school curriculum. Since the middle of the century, criticism of the use of official copies of the <i>Book of Schemes</i> has drawn comparisons to <u>X-treme lecturing</u><sup>3</sup>. The Council of Exarchs denies the comparison as libelous and inaccurate and invites any skeptics to read the "Myth of the Two Swans", specifically in the official translation. For example, the attentive reader may recognize parallels between "Flan and the Titan of the Woods" and Flandre's actions during <u>the Roerbach Incident</u><sup>4</sup>.</p>
<p>Despite its weaponization as a national resource for contingency plans, the renditions of myths in the <i>Book of Schemes</i> are still impressive literary works in their own right. Their creation myth is a grand epic relating the rise and fall of Flan, their patron deity. According to this myth, the existence of the world is the result of Flan's contingency plan in case of nonexistence, which he prepares so expertly that it executes before he is born. Extended quotations from this section of the myth were used in "Origination", the second track of Sneezing on the King Eternal's 961 album <u><i>Iurezza</i></u><sup>5</sup> to critical acclaim. Its reception was especially favorable in Flandre, where it was covered by <u>The Lunchtime Fallacy</u><sup>6</sup> at the coronation of the <u>High Exarch Minor</u><sup>7</sup> in 990. That The Lunchtime Fallacy was allowed to leave in one piece after crashing the Flandrean coronation is a testament to the enduring power of this song.</p>

Scholarly consensus is that the organization—a term they earn by the thinnest of margins—did not exist in any significant capacity even as late as the ninth century.  With the AES 715 discovery of <u>alien ruins</u><sup>1</sup> on the south pole, societies worldwide were aware of ancient alien presences.  However, it wasn't until AES 923 that popular consciousness embraced the idea of aliens interfering in every part of history and/or contemporary society.  The idea of the Botherhood, a mysterious conspiracy carrying out the whims of its alien overseers, grew out of this fervor.  The meme seems to have spread initially via space enthusiast magazines before making the jump into conspiracy culture in the 50's, where it would gestate before reaching its current form.</p></div>
<p>A brief diversion before we continue: conspiracy culture is rather interesting from a memetosociological standpoint because to engage in conspiracy is to directly challenge the prevailing memetic narratives of your society.  The actions a conspiracist takes from that position illuminate to us the limits of the influence of both the master narratives and the counternarratives which the conspiracists employ.  Memetosociologists speak of "command narratives" that have the ability to shape society; conspiracy theorists are an excellent weathervane for whether a particular narrative is a command narrative, as they might verbally deny a command narrative, but still act in accordance with it.</p>
<p>I explain this to shed light on why the first Botherhood cells were found in <u>Iurezza</u><sup>2</sup>.  In Barcu, the command narrative about otherworldly threats is essentially one of self-preservative collusion, e.g. in the case of the <u>Killer Bus of Kingsland North</u><sup>3</sup>.  In neighboring <u>Flandre</u><sup>4</sup>, the command narrative about threats is that they are assessed and then efficiently dispatched.  At the intersection of these memetic vectors—which arose mostly in northern Flandre—conspiracy theorists began to create their <i>own</i> Botherhood cells, hoping to get absorbed by the true Botherhood and influence them from within.  These cells were eventually absorbed, not into the "true" Botherhood, but into other imposter cells hoping that the resulting increase of prestige would bring them to the attention of their notional alien overlords.  This trend has continued into the present day, with the Botherhood becoming a convoluted international conspiracy—still, one assumes, waiting for the aliens to contact them.</p>
<p>Outsiders to the Botherhood mostly find them perplexing, as they will occasionally undertake arbitrary endeavors in case they serve the aliens' agenda.  The lack of any overall agenda means these plots happen essentially at random, making them a convenient scapegoat for state actions like the <u>986 Bring Your Daughter to Work Day Incident</u><sup>5</sup> or <u>Queen Beneficent the Plenitudinous</u><sup>6</sup>'s secret police disappearing her citizens.  Some commenters also suspect some overlap between the Botherhood and <u>The Esoteric Order of Florists</u><sup>7</sup>, but saner scholars withhold judgement, as there is literally no evidence whatsoever for that hypothesis.</p>

Buddy Johnson is <i>literally</i> made of snakes. People sometimes get the wrong impression, because to the unaided eye he appears just like everyone else. But unlike a human, every single one of his cells is a tightly-packed snake. He needs only to sneeze to fill a room from floor to ceiling with snakes as they uncurl themselves to full size. He can hiss as loud as the <u>Selesteine national anthem</u><sup>1</sup>, and probably much louder if he tries. He can squeeze his body through any hole large enough to fit his bones, which are the only parts of him that aren't made of snakes &mdash; as far as we know.</p></div>
<p>Terrible things always come from Barcu, of course, and Johnson is no exception. But where did <i>he</i> come from, specifically? Opinions are divided. Some say that he was once a man who became snakes. Others say that he was once snakes who became a man. The former view has to its advantage that the inordinate number of snakes that make up Johnson would have been noticeable before they became him. The latter view has to its advantage that he usually appears as the sort of generic human you'd come up with if you were an alien trying to make a human disguise, and "Buddy Johnson" is pretty up there on the list of most generic names.</p>
<p>Who or whatever he was before he was Literally Made of Snakes &mdash; assuming he <i>was</i> anything before &mdash; he first appeared in Kingsland on <u>Tesseraction Eve</u><sup>2</sup> in AES 954, when all of the city's storm drains began inexplicably disgorging snakes at high pressure into the air. Some of the snake-clouds that formed drifted south to <u>Flandre</u><sup>3</sup>, but most precipitated where they formed over Kingsland. When the snake geysers dissipated and the snakes had drained into the river, Buddy Johnson climbed out, literally made of snakes. From then on, he became a fixture of Kingsland South, terrorizing the populace that lived there. Southside got a brief respite in 987, when they managed to get him elected as the mayor, forcing him to leave the city for Disputatious Assembly sessions. This was short-lived, however. After a few months, Johnson sat snakes in every free seat in the Assembly, becoming for a moment the majority vote <i>per se</i>, and then unilaterally banned himself from the Assembly. An attempted resistance by the Flandrean High Exarch Cerberus Ironheart was foiled by <u>the Hegemon of Whales</u><sup>4</sup>; Johnson would subsequently <u>invade Flandre for revenge</u><sup>5</sup>. He was finally driven out in 990 by the newly ascended <u>High Exarch Minor Seraphi Ironheart</u><sup>6</sup>, and not been seen since.</p>

'Course, "a wizard did it" isn't all that scholarly of an explanation, so maybe that cult went off and bred snakes like mad for the next thousand years or so.  Either way.</p>

<p></p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>Captain Jango "Space" Gunnerson</h2><p><b>Captain Jango "Space" Gunnerson</b> is an archeologist, astronaut, and military veteran.  He is known for his outspoken opposition to <u>Klaus Santanna</u><sup>1</sup> and for being the first Kingslander to voluntarily reach space.</p></div>
<p>Captain Gunnerson is widely known in connection with his work on the <u>Ultimate Dragonopolis</u><sup>2</sup>.  A self-described xenoenthusiast and expert in <u>Vulterbase</u><sup>3</sup> research, Gunnerson has published multiple papers arguing that the space ship that brought the ruins' creators to this planet must still be in in orbit.  In these papers, Gunnerson has advanced multiple independent arguments with varying degrees of factual support.  One paper argues that whoever built the ruins obviously lived in them, so as long as they travelled here, whatever method of transport they used to get here must still be here.  Another paper badly mangles atmospheric physics to allegedly "prove" evidence of alien vessels breaching the atmosphere.  Tales of the Dragonopolis go back many years, of course, but most scholars consider them mythical.  The general academic consensus is that Gunnerson's arguments are based more in wish fulfillment than credible scientific research.</p>
<p>With such a consensus, Gunnerson shockingly did not receive any grant money from <u>Iurezzan</u><sup>4</sup> universities to fund a spacefaring expedition to locate the Ultimate Dragonopolis.  This did not deter him, however, and he appealed across the water to the National University of <u>Shaster</u><sup>5</sup>, whose culture is better suited to scientific inquiry of such calibre.  At last, a ship was assembled and Gunnerson earned his name.</p>
<p>Gunnerson's expedition took everyone by surprise, not only because he survived, but because he returned with measurement data that would actually seem to vindicate his theory that the ship is still out there.  Radar has been less than fruitful in trying to detect the ship, which Gunnerson and his allies explain away by arguing that a good spaceship would absorb all forms of radiation.  What Gunnerson did instead was look for gravitational anomalies.  Fortunately for him, he discovered one floating in the shadow of <u>Zor Olo</u><sup>6</sup>.  Opponents of his research argue that the readings might also indicate an <u>ominous fixed-point cube</u><sup>7</sup>, or perhaps <u>The Lunchtime Fallacy</u><sup>8</sup> lurking aboard the <i>Rainbow's Teeth</i> as they plot their next guerrilla show.</p>
<p>Gunnerson's objective for the Dragonopolis is rather straight-forward: he intends to board it, arm its weapon systems, and then wipe <u>Bipolaris</u><sup>9</sup> off the map.  This has caused some tension between the Compass Republic and Shaster, given that the latter funded the first expedition.  The fact that the tension has yet to escalate either indicates that Shaster's diplomats are doing their job well, or that Santanna thinks planetary bombardment by an advanced alien vessel is nothing to worry about.</p>

It is, bar none, the <u>Guild of Mapmakers'</u><sup>1</sup> least favorite continent. Nor is it a surprise that <u>Lepazzia</u><sup>2</sup> picked up their entire country and left the continent behind in the fourth century &mdash; an event that didn't make the Guild any happier.</p></div>
<p>Why, exactly, the Careless Continent is in a state of constant warfare and regime change is lost to history. More specifically, so many competing histories have been promulgated by the ephemeral governments of Careless that the task of sifting through them for the nuggets of truth is herculean. Actually visiting the continent for archaeology is out of the question: to get to anything that <i>isn't</i> already collateral damage requires trekking through multiple active war zones.</p>
<p>It's not clear that the various nations of Careless even care what the reasons are. For them, instability is simply the way life is. In most of the languages of Careless, the word for "government" shares a root with the word for "temporary structure". Sovereigns rotate in and out of the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns so often that the consensus is now that Careless nations only declare themselves a state in order to send a champion as a sovereign to the Assembly to fight another nation's sovereign, because they'll be in an easy-to-find location, and anybody they sent to the Assembly must have been important. Getting used to/dodging the sparring sovereigns of Careless is something of a rite of passage for new members of the Assembly. <u>The Hegemon of Whales</u><sup>3</sup>, given the great cultural barrier between humans and whales, has still not gotten used to it, and blames <u>Flandre</u><sup>4</sup>.</p>
<p>Ever since <u>certain events six years ago</u><sup>5</sup> in the Assembly, <u>the Secretary</u><sup>6</sup> has quarantined the sovereigns of the Careless Continent in the "Time-Out Corner". Some of the other sovereigns have expressed disapproval with this measure, both at the implication that unruly sovereigns are like so many misbehaving children to Secretary Tomas, and at the consequence that the Careless sovereigns now fight even <i>more</i>, since nobody is in the way. Tomas, in response has pointed out that because they are out of the way, their fighting is quicker and less distracting.</p>

DAS Secretary Ruby Tomas</p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>Chorus Perpetual</h2><p>Just as human civilization, which communicates by speaking, prizes a beautiful oration, so the hyperintelligent whales of our oceans hold whalesong in a place of cultural importance. The most important whalesong in the oceans is also the oldest. In the nonspecifically distant past (whales have no calendars), in response to some nebulous catastrophe, the whales gathered together and began to sing. Believing that this song would protect them from danger, they sang it in shifts, with whales joining in and dropping out at intervals to maintain the song in perpetuity. This became the <i>Euouao Euouaoou</i>, variously translated as "hymn until the finish", "supplication unto the end", or "endless song", and officially notarized by the Disputatious Assembly as the <b>Chorus Perpetual</b>.</p></div>
<p>The Chorus is the closest thing in <u>the Hegemony of Whales</u><sup>1</sup> to a state religion. The location is a state secret, and there are likely several places in the deep sea that it moves between. It figured prominently in whale propaganda during the Cetacean Wars, or so the translators told the historians. The continuance  of the Chorus is linguistically tied to the seasonal cycle, and the closest thing the Hegemony has to a calendar is measuring time by rounds of the Chorus. Most cetacean cultural scholars understand the singing of the Chorus to be, in the cetacean mind, inextricable from the passage of time itself. This has given rise to multiple rumors about what would happen were the Chorus to end, the most popular of which appeals to the seasonal and calendrical lingustic parallels to suggest that the measure of time maintained by the Chorus is the revolution of the planet around the sun. On this theory, the end of the Chorus would be the end of our orbit, causing us to either fall into the sun or fly off into space. The Hegemony, for its part, encourages this speculation, as do its allies among the <u>biosphere fascists</u><sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>Skeptics will generally rail against these theories, clamoring things like, "Whales evolved long after our orbit was established!" or, "<u>Space persuasion</u><sup>3</sup> doesn't work that way!" These are fair points, deserving of a fair response. My colleague Dr. Christophy would probably insist on the sociophysical explanation that whether or not the orbit depended on the Chorus Perpetual's perpetuity before, centuries of the whales thinking so mean it does now. But turning to a real scientific field, we can take heart in the wisdom of the imagineer Dyrus the Dreadful, who pointed out that there's just a lot of weird stuff in the world, like <u>ominous cubes</u><sup>4</sup>, <u>indeterminate color</u><sup>5</sup>, and <u>fish</u><sup>6</sup>, and who knows if our measurements on orbital decay might be affected by something like whalesong?</p>
<p>I mean "take heart" in the Kingslander sense, of course, i.e., "[fear for your life as if someone were trying to] take [your] heart [out of your chest with a rusty spoon]", because you never know when an unnoticed <u>squid-tree</u><sup>7</sup> grove might send us plunging into the sun. At least it'd make Kingsland more tolerable.</p>

<p>1. The Hegemony of Whales<br>2. Biosphere fascism<br>3. Space persuasion<br>4. Ominous fixed-point cubes<br>5. Chromatic aberration<br>6. Metafishics<br>7. Ravenous Squid-Trees</p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>Chromatic aberration</h2><p>Scientists are generally undecided as to whether <b>chromatic aberration</b>, an observer-independent uncertainty to an object's color, is a physical or a psychological phenomenon. I, however, think the explanation is clear: chromatic aberration is a <i>sociophysical</i> phenomenon above all else. It is well known in the field of sociophysics that the social milieu changes the laws of physics. Since the color of light is governed by the light's physical properties, any social influence on such properties will manifest as visible change. This sort of sociophysics can affect attention in mixed settings, such as when one feels "socially invisible". Often social invisibility is accompanied by <i>actual</i> invisibility, which could explain why the <u>Incendian</u><sup>1</sup> sovereign's vote is sometimes skipped in the Disputatious Assembly. I am also convinced, personally, that this is what has become of the Sovereign of <u>Placeholden</u><sup>2</sup>.</p></div>
<p>In the case of chromatic aberration, the underlying sociophysics is probably tied to an object's color being highly significant as an indicator of something, and this indication being uncertain. The uncertainty or ambiguity in the indication of the object then "bleeds", as it were, into the object's reflective properties, and thence into the light it reflects. This was a major plot point in the romantic comedy <i>Unto Kingsland</i>, where the male lead gives a bouquet to the female lead, who is versed in flower symbolism, but the bouquet exhibits chromatic aberration because of his conflicted feelings, leaving her unable to interpret the gesture. I've always thought myself that a few of the lines in "Annihilation" from <u><i>Iurezza</i></u><sup>3</sup> are about chromatic aberration, but Sneezing on the King Eternal are well-known for their abstract and sometimes nonsensical metaphors, so I might just be reading too much into it.</p>
<p>On the sociophysical account, the basic principles that cause chromatic aberration also account for other phenomena, such as mass chromatic delusion, the term being used to describe how everyone agrees that the national flag of Kingsland is red and green instead of the hideous, sanity-warping colors it says it is in the notaries' official records. Similarly, the colored flags in <u>that old legend</u><sup>4</sup> appear as different colors to each character. A variation on sociophysical chromatic aberration would explain this handily. Please fund my research.</p>
<p>I have also heard people suggest that chromatic aberration could be due to secret government technology or something cooked up by <u>the Esoteric Order of Florists</u><sup>5</sup>, which are also possible explanations, I guess.</p>

The Esoteric Order of Florists</p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>Concluding Recommendations: Cincinatta Rubric</h2><p>Honored sovereigns of the Disputatious Assembly, I realize that taking my recommendations regarding the Disarrangement Act to heart may be difficult, in light of <u>my particular qualifications</u><sup>1</sup> and the polarizing debate over my appointment to this solemn committee. In the spirit of approaching the problem before us objectively, therefore, I ask that you consider the other sovereigns in this chamber, especially the ones who opposed my appointment. I bet my <u>gold star</u><sup>2</sup> for the week that you distrust half of those bastards at least as much as you distrust me. With that in mind, my recommendations.</p></div>
<p>I heartily endorse the Disarrangement Act, but I have some concerns over the most common implementation details floating around. For starters, it is absolutely essential that Kingsland be moved from its current land, even if the standard procedure will be to move a country with its land. We've tried everything under the sun to get rid of our troubles, from <u>asking them nicely to leave</u><sup>3</sup> to <u>electing them mayor</u><sup>4</sup>. Don't throw us under the <u>bus</u><sup>5</sup> here.</p>
<p>One major practical concern for moving countries around is that every continent has some number of <u>ominous fixed-point cubes</u><sup>6</sup> embedded in its bedrock. In order to be able to move them, therefore, I recommend that the land be divided not along national lines, but rather along lines drawn between neighboring subterranean cubes. This may require redrawing some national boundaries, but let's be honest, <u>the Partitioning</u><sup>7</sup> was a long time ago and I'm sure the up-and-coming generation of <u>cartographers</u><sup>8</sup> would like to make their mark (literally) on history. Based on cube charts, these chunks should also be easier to move around, which brings me to my next recommendation.</p>
<p>Everybody in the world is worried about the glut of <u>ravenous squid-trees</u><sup>9</sup> in the oceans. What if the <u>Hegemony</u><sup>10</sup> fails at keeping an eye on them all, and we get another <i>El Fauces del Diablo</i> situation? Fear not, for these cube-partitioned  pieces of land will be the perfect size for dropping onto clusters of squid-trees. Some <u>biosphere fascists</u><sup>11</sup> once suggested to me that we could even cut some of them round and have <u>the Panarkian biome carriers</u><sup>12</sup> push them around like steamrollers. Currently, Panark isn't a fan of the Disarrangement Act, so eliminating the biggest existential threat to their country at the same time should make it more palatable to them.</p>
<p>Of course, Panark might not like the idea of loading their carriers with gigantic pieces of landmass and going to war with malevolent plants. In that case, I recommend relocating Panark to <u>Zor Olo</u><sup>13</sup> via <u>symphonic warp technology</u><sup>14</sup>. The Assembly will have some wiggle room to shuffle countries around if a few of them are put into space. They won't be lonely, as I'm told <u>the Ulgravian Diaspora</u><sup>15</sup> wants to get its hands on the <u>Ultimate Dragonopolis</u><sup>16</sup> to head there anyway. Panark is the obvious choice to warp to the moon, because they're based in ships already, and symphonic warp traversal works best with something that's already a vehicle. We could have <u>The Lunchtime Fallacy</u><sup>17</sup> pilot each of them up there individually, but they're kind of hard to book, so I suggest just aiming each Panarkian vessel at Zor Olo when it's level with the horizon, sticking a Grimer Primer on the front, and playing "Ascension" from <i><u>Iurezza</u><sup>18</sup></i> into it. Plus, they can run so many <u>divine assembly</u><sup>19</sup> computations because they use the oceans for cooling, right? Well, space is pretty cold, so it'll be <i>even better</i> for them. I'm sure they already know this from all the work they do running the <u>Taurus</u><sup>20</sup>. And if the <u>alleged professor</u><sup>21</sup>, of whose <u>classes</u><sup>22</sup> many of you are alumni, were to be on one of those ships being sent off-world, well, wouldn't that be interesting? But, of course, as long as Panark is <u>persuaded</u><sup>23</sup> to cooperate, you needn't go through the trouble yet.</p>
<p>Another major practical concern, exacerbated by my recommendation above, is that much of the planning has assumed that the countries would be towed or pushed, rather than carried directly on ships. Obviously, towing a piece of land over a squid-tree grove to crush it isn't going to work, because the squid-trees will just eat the ship first. But most ships aren't big enough to fit a landmass on top of them. This is not a hard problem to solve when you think about it. There are at least three forms of <u>hard light projection</u><sup>24</sup> that will work to expand the available holding area of even a small ship, thus allowing them to carry, and then drop, these landmasses on squid-trees and anything else the Assembly deems worthy of being squashed by a piece of continent. The possibility of hard light projections at a massive scale has been empirically demonstrated in the <u>Autocratic Plenitude of Mizzin</u><sup>25</sup>, where massive arrays of projectors close off all avenues of escape after curfew before the Queen releases her innumerable hordes of <u>marionette children</u><sup>26</sup> to clean the streets of garbage and curfew delinquents.</p>
<p>Finally, I recommend that the beginning of the Disarrangement be scheduled for the day after <u>Tesseraction Eve</u><sup>27</sup>. While in some sense the Disarrangement will be a vindication of the unreasonable hope cultivated by some Kingslanders that something will eventually deliver us from Kingsland, I think a more compelling reason can be offered to those not from the city. As much as I wholeheartedly support the Act, I recognize that many things could go horribly wrong. What if we launch Panark at Zor Olo, they don't decelerate in time, and the impact of their ships vaporizing against the surface of the moon cracks it open and releases whatever is sealed inside? What if we're not careful with how we crush the ravenous squid-trees with our landmasses, and we end up stranding countries in the middle of hungry, aquatic forests of death? What if the Hegemony celebrates its victory and accidentally cuts off the <u>Chorus Perpetual</u><sup>28</sup>, and we plunge into the sun?</p>
<p>Well, then maybe you'll all know what we deal with on a daily fucking basis in Kingsland.</p>

Chorus Perpetual</p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>Concluding Recommendations: Dr. Gwen Hanson</h2><p>Mighty Sovereigns of the Assembly, I bring before you a matter of consequences far outstripping other matters.  I speak of justice&mdash;I speak of the philosophical kind, not the <u>academic kind</u><sup>1</sup>.  Historically, it has been the belief of many intelligent and successful leaders that nothing is higher than justice.</p></div>
<p>Sovereigns of the Assembly, those otherwise intelligent leaders were wrong.  There is at least one thing higher than justice.  Here's a hint: What has an average cruising altitude of 2 miles, has already <u>wiped one country off the map</u><sup>2</sup>, and carries eight million descendants of the angriest fucking warriors this world has ever known?  That's right, the <u>Ulgravian motherfucking Diaspora</u><sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p>And so, Sovereigns of the Assembly, I have one question for you today: <i>Do you want to fuck with us?</i></p>
<p>If your answer is "no," then we're done here.  All you have to do is vote in favor of the Disarrangement Act and make sure we get some land when you finish re-apportioning everything.  I don't even care if it's some corner of the <u>Careless Continent</u><sup>4</sup> where we end up at war with all of our neighbors, it's not like that's not fucking par for the course in our history.  There's a reason the <u>Grim Weepers</u><sup>5</sup>' standard weapons were designed to take down horses&mdash;it's cuz <u>Selestei</u><sup>6</sup> <i>had to take special measures to face us militarily</i>.  You know, Selestei?  The guys who <u>fought the rest of the world for fun</u><sup>7</sup>?  The ones who are famous for <u>rolling their opponents' horses into a giant ball</u><sup>8</sup>?  Those guys?  Even <u>Pentex Lannogaster</u><sup>9</sup> wrote that "We rejoice in those who <u>become as Sels</u><sup>10</sup>, for there are none whose courage alone suffices to turn back the charge of a horseprince."  That was on <i>horses</i>.  We're in fucking <i>armored flying machines</i> now.</p>
<p>But okay, I recognize that some of you have fecal matter instead of brains, so I'll humor this asinine thread of conversation. 
 Let's say you're a total moron and you do want to fuck with us.  Let me knock out some of the objections I've heard.</p>
<p>First off, some of you have been smugly repeating the line that the <u>I'll Legislate It Act</u><sup>11</sup> outlaws moving countries around.  You're fucking wrong.  The Act prohibits "The deliberate or incidental shifting of national borders by means of a third party, with or without the consent of the involved parties, until such time as such third parties are subscribed under the provisions outlined in §340 ¶4 lines 70-80."  First of all, what a fucking law.  You should all collectively feel ashamed of yourselves for this abomination's existence.  Second, did you fuckers even read §340 ¶4 lines 70-80?  That whole part of the I'll Legislate It Act was only added in to limit the <u>Guild of Mapmakers</u><sup>12</sup> from doing anything too threatening without the Assembly getting a say on it.  Which is exactly what you will have done, if you pass the Disarrangement Act.  Good fucking luck.  I hope your <u>mad lawyers</u><sup>13</sup> are expensive.</p>
<p>Second big thing&mdash;that this brings the world into open season on everyone else's resources, isn't really an argument.  It's mostly just whining on the part of those who don't want to lose the stuff their country happens to sit on.  Come on, <u>Flandre</u><sup>14</sup>, did your protomammalian ancestors do a geological survey before deciding to settle down on those oil fields?  Hell, you don't even need them with all that <u>asynchronous energy</u><sup>15</sup> you're producing.  Executing the Disarrangement Act is gonna take a while, so use the time to build some really friggin' huge batteries and store it all up.</p>
<p>Like, I get the argument that we can't just go around redistributing resources <i>ad hoc.</i>  But that's not what's going on here.  The point of the Disarrangement Act is to <i>reduce world conflict</i>, so that's the metric we'd use to determine whether to move a nation off a given piece of land.  Flandre has exploited its oil to thwart the <u>whale tariffs</u><sup>16</sup> and increase tension in the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns, so in order to promote world peace we should really appropriate that oil and put it to some more peaceful end, like keeping eight million people's homes in the air.  The <u>Very Definitely Independent States</u><sup>17</sup> aren't hurting anyone by sticking together, so the Assembly could make sure they stay together.  The opposite is true for the <u>Fractured Cities</u><sup>18</sup>, so you could separate them.  See?  Really easy decision-making process.  I'm sure you're all competent enough that you can make those decisions as an Assembly.  You're not afraid to prove it, right?</p>
<p>Third thing, people have been arguing that there won't be enough space for everyone.  Many proposed mechanisms for instituting the Disarrangement Act render large chunks of the planet uninhabitable, at least temporarily.  This argument is spurious for many, many reasons.  First of all, we've already lost large chunk of the planet and been totally fine.  You don't hear the whales having space issues in the aftermath of the <u>Yggdrasil Project</u><sup>19</sup>, do you?  What's more, this would really just provide incentives for people to exploit new spaces, such as space.  You could put <u>Lepazzia</u><sup>20</sup> on <u>Zor Olo</u><sup>21</sup>, for example.  I'm sure there's some wonderful device by the inspiring <u>Dr. Stafford</u><sup>22</sup> that would do the trick.  And don't pretend like they wouldn't enjoy it, since they're the first country in world history to try to leave and take their country with them.  In their stupid backwards culture, you'd probably even be doing them a favor by stranding them on the moon.  I proposed this to <u>President Niir</u><sup>23</sup> and he thought it was a great idea, so you've even got one vote in favor already!</p>
<p>Now, I could refute this chum all day, but I'd like to conclude with more of a positive argument.  The Disarrangement Act will undoubtedly lead to more peace, because otherwise Ulgrav will probably rain sulfurous hell down on your stupid fucking heads.  Maybe you are not afraid of our warships?  Maybe you think you are safe behind your high-altitude artillery?  Then know this: I happen to know Rubric is pulling strongly in favor of the Disarrangement Act, and she's the only one who knows how to work the <u>Omega Point Coffee Secretor</u><sup>24</sup>.  She has become <i>terrifyingly effective</i> with it, and we still don't know the merest fraction of everything it's capable of.  So just imagine that the Act fails to pass.  Imagine that Rubric learns of this.  How upset she will be, knowing she has to return to Kingsland!  In a huff, she storms back to the Butterfly Effect Advisory Committee's break room&mdash;and, hulking sinisterly in the corner, sits that metal leviathan, controls glinting with inbuilt malice.  Her hand strays, slowly, inexorably, to the control panels, and <i>guess who's still sitting in the DAS building?</i></p>
<p>A bunch of poor fools who should have voted yes.  That's who.</p>

I hope that you have found this report enlightening and that it will guide you to choose with the wisdom I have seen in this hall time and again.  I hope also that despite my lowly station you will accept my gratitude for the fine work you have all done in leading your respective countries so well.</p></div>
<p>Now, let us turn to the task at hand.  Many who undertake to write about the Disarrangement Act have seen fit to fall into absolutist camps&mdash;an example I will not follow here.  I believe that perspicacious individuals like yourselves will recognize the nuance of this topic.  So, although I believe that the Disarrangement Act is, on balance, not worth the costs, let's take a moment to acknowledge the good things about it.  There is much to be learned, I think, from such a vision of international cooperation, with the Disputatious Assembly coordinating to design a better world for us all.  I should think such an attitude fulfills the vision of <u>High Exarch Kantamon</u><sup>1</sup> in founding the Assembly in the first place.  Nevertheless, I remain convinced that the actual execution of the Disarrangement Act would be perilous.  I believe my colleagues have done an excellent job of illustrating that peril; however, as is observed in the Armmaker translation of the <u>Book of Schemes</u><sup>2</sup>, "It is a fool who plans for success."  So let's suppose that the Act passes.  In that case, I have a number of concerns which must be observed at any cost in the execution of the Act:</p>
<p>• When moving the countries of the world, the Assembly must not under any circumstances interfere with the Barcu region.  No one fully understands the <u>Barcuvian physical laws</u><sup>3</sup> (save perhaps <u>Dr. Stafford</u><sup>4</sup>), and the methods used to move entire chunks of the planet will surely use massive stores of energy.  The responsible position is to expect that using these methods in Barcu would result in unexpected consequences, and that those consequences will be catastrophic.  To be safe, the Assembly should extend this zone of caution anywhere from ten to a thousand miles from the Barcuvian border.</p>
<p>• As an addendum to the above point, the <u>Missing Sea</u><sup>5</sup> should be disturbed as little as possible.  In addition to the caution necessary to deal with Barcu, there is a possibility that disrupting the Missing Sea too much will also disrupt the seal upon Zor Olo and release whatever is trapped there.</p>
<p>• Speaking of Zor Olo, do not put any countries on Zor Olo.  Not only is there the possibility of creating a second Kingsland, there is no air up there.  The entire country would be dead in minutes.  I confess I do not understand why I keep running into this suggestion.</p>
<p>• Returning to the general prohibition on interfering with Barcu, the Assembly should not interfere with <u>Flandre</u><sup>6</sup>.  While I understand that this is politically unfavorable for some, the fact remains that most of the country is tied into an <u>asynchronous energy</u><sup>7</sup> network, and the theoretical consequences of severing that connection range from disastrous to apocalyptic.  While I cannot speak to the justice of <u>High Exarch Minor Ironheart</u><sup>8</sup>'s use of her country's resources, I beg you to turn your attention to the justice of blowing the planet open.</p>
<p>• Although it is a difficult decision to countenance, the Assembly must not let Kingsland escape.  If their <u>gods</u><sup>9</sup> become unhappy, we might see the horrors of Kingsland visited upon the rest of the world.</p>
<p>• In fact, the Assembly should probably just refrain from interfering with <u>Iurezza</u><sup>10</sup> in general, as that might result in breaching the quarantine on the <u>electric undead</u><sup>11</sup> and starting a new infestation.</p>
<p>• Given the massive logistical requirements the Disarrangement Act would introduce to the global community, I agree with <u>Professor Hazard McKinley</u><sup>12</sup>'s argument that the Assembly should delay implementation of the Act until such time as transportation has been developed that would not put an unendurable strain on the environment.</p>
<p>• The implementation of the Disarrangement Act must not proceed in a way that precludes our ability to defend against hostile attention from space.  <u>General Gorson</u><sup>13</sup> had the right of it when he said that an alien threat is of more concern than any terrestrial matter; what we've learned from the <u>Vulterland ruins</u><sup>14</sup> certainly seems to corroborate this point.  This prohibition would extend to prohibiting interference with the <u>Panark Fleet</u><sup>15</sup>, who carry the responsibility for maintaining <u>Taurus Research Station</u><sup>16</sup> as an orbital defense platform.  Also included here are any number of precautions to prevent sabotage from the <u>Botherhood</u><sup>17</sup>, who might see sabotage of such a great undertaking as pleasing to their notional alien masters.</p>
<p>• However the Act unfolds with respect to the <u>Careless Continent</u><sup>18</sup>, great care must be taken not to open <u>Joran Lake</u><sup>19</sup> to the ocean.  Joran Lake is unnaturally deep, and its blackest reaches have been open to unchecked <u>metafishics</u><sup>20</sup> for over a hundred years.</p>
<p>• On the topic of metafishics, the Assembly must ensure that as the continents are shifted and the ocean grows silty, some mechanism is deployed to observe the parts of the ocean which would otherwise be hidden to us.  Ideally this technology would be able to penetrate groves of <u>Ravenous Squid-Trees</u><sup>21</sup>.</p>
<p>• Under absolutely no circumstances should the Assembly use <u>symphonic warp traversal</u><sup>22</sup> as a means of transportation during the implementation of the Disarrangement Act.  Warping mass on this scale has never been tested in atmosphere before, but my physics contacts inform me that the theoretical <i>best-case</i> scenario detonates the entire atmosphere.</p>
<p>• Perhaps this is the old rocker in me speaking, but per Sneezing on the King Eternal's <i><u>Iurezza</u><sup>23</sup></i>, the Assembly should not involve the <u>Ultimate Dragonopolis</u><sup>24</sup> in the implementation of the Act.  In the event that the Act passes, seekers after the Dragonopolis (particularly <u>Captain Gunnerson</u><sup>25</sup>) should be grounded until the process is complete.</p>
<p>• Finally, we do know (via Kingsland) of the existence of multidimensional entities who wish to consume our reality.  There is the possibility (raised by Dr. Hanson in her excellent article on <u>Zor Olo</u><sup>26</sup>, although she seems to have forgotten it in writing her concluding recommendations) that the exact shape of the continents is what keeps them from doing so.  In the interest of avoiding dimensional predators, the Assembly should endeavor to change the shape of the globe as little as possible.</p>
<p>Now, as I'm sure you've noticed, the logical consequence of abiding by all of these considerations would be, effectively, to act as though the Disarrangement Act had not passed.  I hope it is a little clearer why I do not recommend that the Assembly vote in favor, whatever pressing issues seem to hang on its success.  But that decision is, of course, up to you.</p>
<p>In any case, this report is now concluded.  I hereby discharge the duty placed upon this committee by the august Assembly and wish you happy deliberations!</p>

Zor Olo</p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>Concluding Recommendations: Dr. Remilion Christophy</h2><p>Rather than add to the observed geopolitical consequences of the Disarrangement Act, I would like to contribute a recommendation from the perspective of the field of sociophysics. As you surely know, sociophysicists study the ways in which social realities cause variation in or manifestation of physical realities. The social consequences of carrying out the Disarrangement Act would be indubitably immense, and sociophysics tells us that we should be wary of equally immense physical consequences.</p></div>
<p>For starters, there's just kind of a lot of weird stuff on <u>Iurezza</u><sup>1</sup>. The Ideal Geology Committee has already thoroughly informed you as to the dangers of moving Barcuvian land or moving other land to Barcu's present location. If <u>Barcu's peculiarities</u><sup>2</sup> are defined according to global coordinates, then whatever country ends up there may see something new and horrible arise, <u>if it even lasts that long</u><sup>3</sup>. But what the IGC didn't consider, and therefore falls to the Butterfly Effect Advisory Committee, is whether Barcu might be in the state it is in because of sociophysical effects deriving from the structure of global society. Of course, records indicate that Barcu has been Barcuvian for much longer than the current geopolitical climate, but this is not the last word on the subject. As my colleague Ms. Rubric mentioned in her article on the <u>Chorus Perpetual</u><sup>4</sup>, I've proposed a sociophysical explanation of the <u>Hegemony's</u><sup>5</sup> claims about the Chorus and its relation to the stability of our solar orbit. Even though our orbit may not have depended on on the Chorus before, sociological momentum from the repetition of the claim may make it the case that it does now. I suggest that something similar may have happened to Barcu, which has become, in this global age of ours, a symbol the world over for senselessness and chaos.</p>
<p>Given this, if we move around large groups of people, their sense of direction may become confused, and they may regard Barcu to be located in the wrong direction. Through sociophysical principles, this may result in the direction of their regard becoming Barcuvian. Additionally, moving all of the countries around will undoubtedly cause vast amounts of chaos. Might this not cause people to regard the whole world as having become, in a sense, Barcu? Each of you Sovereigns should consider whether, having avoided your country being moved to Barcu, Barcu might yet move to your country. There are good reasons to think that disarranging the countries of the world will shift or expand Barcu's idiomatic physics to cover much larger swaths of the world, or even entire hemispheres. This would be utterly disastrous.</p>
<p>The most wide-ranging effects are obvious, but there are others you should know about in case you think it would be worth the risk. First, note that hurricanes do not currently form in any region subject to Barcuvian physics. While the Ideal Geology Committee has already noted this as a risk of leaving Barcu's place unfilled by a new landmass, a Barcuvian expansion would almost certainly result in the formation of antihurricanes. I have no idea what an antihurricane would do, but I don't want to find out and neither should you. Second, and I note that the IGC did not consider this in their discussion of disarranging Barcu, such areas of open ocean will be subject both to Barcuvian physics and to <u>Grantham's Law</u><sup>6</sup>. There's no way we could muster enough people to willingly enter Barcuvian oceans just to keep an eye on the aquatic life. The consequences will be unimaginably horrific. If we're lucky, an antihurricane will just be <u>invisible</u><sup>7</sup>, and countries near Barcuvian oceans will occasionally be destroyed by storms they can't see coming. In the worst case, the antihurricanes could have an inexplicable ability to pick up aquatic life and deposit them inland.</p>
<p>Some <u>Ulgravian</u><sup>8</sup> agitators in favor of the Disarrangement Act have argued that even if Barcu expands, this will simply give more countries access to <u>free energy</u><sup>9</sup>. Disregard these charlatans. I have noted the dangers of asynchronous energy previously. It would only exacerbate the issue to widen access to it.</p>
<p>And Barcu is merely  the biggest problem on the continent that you don't want to touch. Trying to do almost anything to Iurezza means tampering with forces beyond mortal ken. How do you think the King Eternal is going to take the news that you've moving the Barrowlands? (Do you even have enough interns to get the message across?) All the <u>electric undead</u><sup>10</sup> are going to end up <i>somewhere</i> after the Disarrangement, and you might find yourself the host. If and when the Disarrangement shifts the borders of Barcu, the location of <u>the Double-North Pole</u><sup>11</sup> is going to shift too. If this angers <u>Klaus Santanna</u><sup>12</sup>, you'd better hope <u>Captain Gunnerson</u><sup>13</sup> finds the <u>Ultimate Dragonopolis</u><sup>14</sup> soon. If Santanna instead chooses to relocate Bipolaris to wherever the new Pole ends up, God help anybody in its path.</p>
<p>Now, to touch briefly on geopolitics, I must recognize that there is significant dispute going on in the Disputatious Assembly over the Disarrangement Act, and much of it concerns <u>Flandre</u><sup>15</sup>. Many of Flandre's opponents in the Assembly &mdash; most notably the originator of the Act, the Hegemony of Whales &mdash; want a Disarrangement that severs Flandre from the oil fields that have made it a world power in the wake of the Whale Tariffs. In order to gain support from those outside of the Hegemony's voting bloc, pro-Act diplomats have played up the threat that Flandre poses to the good order and peace of the world. I note one potential consequence of this that might give such partisans pause. As <u>General Kade Gorson</u><sup>16</sup> once remarked, "Do not fear the ocean, lest it become fearful to you." The wisdom of these words is backed up by sociophysics. If there are widespread rumors that Flandre is a global threat, this may in turn make Flandre even more of a global threat than it was before the rumors. This means the <i>true</i> threat to world peace is actually the pro-Act faction. I trust the sovereigns of the Assembly will vote accordingly.</p>
<p>Finally, if you'll recall my previous discussion of <u>🔇</u><sup>17</sup>, it is critically important that the Assembly takes several things about 🔇 into account. First of all,</p>

Pierce Milton</h2><p>As a memetosociologist, I feel a somewhat paradoxical duty to point out when perception does <i>not</i> influence reality.  While it is demonstrably true that much of society's function is determined by participants' models of what those functions are, it is equally true that people forget that there are limitations when you investigate from this perspective.  In the <u>Legend of the Three Trees</u><sup>1</sup>, an argument over national pride belies a challenge to the disputants' survival itself.  And, likewise, I fear that in the discussion over the Disarrangement Act, we are too concerned with which tree is whose, and not nearly enough about which tree is going to fall on us.</p></div>
<p>I begin by interrogating the dominant narrative of the Disarrangement Act, which is that it seeks to create world peace by moving belligerents away from each other.  I am honestly surprised that a thinking person could entertain this argument in good faith for more than a few moments.  Even a brief examination of world history reveals the absurdity of the notion.  Less than three centuries ago, the <u>War of Durun's Ass</u><sup>2</sup> illustrated that a sufficiently motivated country could project military force to the other side of the globe with little more than a borrowed fleet of <u>residential vessels</u><sup>3</sup>.  <u>The Roerbach Incident</u><sup>4</sup> proved that the Assembly itself could serve as the root of conflict, regardless of where the disputing Sovereigns sit their thrones.</p>
<p>In fact, the informed student of history would be forgiven for thinking the shortest road to world peace requires preventing <u>Selestei</u><sup>5</sup> from projecting force into other countries&mdash;a lesson which we know at least <u>Shaster</u><sup>6</sup> has taken to heart, given their quick response to Selesteine militarization during the <u>Goats on Boats Affair</u><sup>7</sup>.  And yet Selestei has never come up in the rhetoric surrounding the Disarrangement Act.  Likewise, the Act's proponents do not mention any threat posed by <u>the Ulgravian Diaspora</u><sup>8</sup>, despite their global force projection capabilities and the <u>blood of an entire country</u><sup>9</sup> on their hands.  One would assume that if global peace were truly an objective of the Act's defenders, they would at least make some superficial arguments that grounding Ulgrav makes it harder for them to bomb us into oblivion.  But no such arguments exist; we merely hear about how <u>Flandre</u><sup>10</sup> threatens world peace, despite Flandre never having engaged in direct military action against a recognized nation (this qualifier in recognition of the grey area of the Cetacean Wars).</p>
<p>One might make the (quite reasonable) objection that the threat of Flandre comes not from military action, but covert actions taken against other members of the global community.  I agree completely.  But if we admit intrigue into the scope of concern, then surely it would be criminal negligence not to mention <u>Lepazzia</u><sup>11</sup>, who blur the lines between our constructs of peace and conflict.  Flandrean intelligence operations only serve to solidify Flandre's position on the international stage; meanwhile, the <u>Massively Parallel Peace Conference</u><sup>12</sup> did more to set back the cause of global peace than anything Flandre's done in the past three centuries.  I would further argue that their inventive utilization of the <u>Esoteric Order of Florists</u><sup>13</sup> in destroying the sanity of <u>Mad King Westler</u><sup>14</sup> makes them a threat to the national security of every other nation on the planet&mdash;save perhaps the <u>Hegemony of Whales</u><sup>15</sup>&mdash;regardless of where those nations are located.  And what of the other dark horse threats?  If the <u>Contagious Republic</u><sup>16</sup> decides to infect a world leader and cause global chaos, how will moving the countries around do anything to stop them?  We don't know, because we see only silence from champions of the Disarrangement Act on these topics.</p>
<p>Given that the pro-Act rhetoric seems insincere, strip that away.  What are we left with?  A proposal by a prominent Assembly nation to strip their largest rival of the key resource that allows them to be a threat.  Noble Sovereigns, I have no stake in the conflict between Flandre and the Hegemony, but I do have a stake in the planet's continued peace and prosperity, and I fear that the collateral damage of this maneuver is strictly unacceptable.  Since the Disarrangement Act was presented to the Assembly, multiple studies out of the <u>National Academy of Velskyavo</u><sup>17</sup> have confirmed that indicators of global tension have reached the levels that typically precede wars.  Troublingly, this includes a record number of <u>bloodmoots</u><sup>18</sup> in the <u>Fractured Cities</u><sup>19</sup> this year, a particularly robust indicator of global unrest.  And we are already seeing negative impacts from the Act: the <u>Stratsky Foundation for Economics and Insurrection</u><sup>20</sup> has released an analysis demonstrating that the global uncertainty is driving trade into the ground.</p>
<p>This is to say nothing of possible <i>existential</i> threats, which one would hope top the list of the Assembly's priorities.  A recent paper by <u>Professor Hazard McKinley</u><sup>21</sup> made the observation that the Disarrangement Act would necessarily include massively increased sea travel, likely pushing pollution levels into unrecoverable territory.  Does the Hegemony fear Flandre so much that they're willing to destroy their own country to neuter them?  And given the prospective transportation of entire people groups across open water, why does the Disarrangement Act contain no provisions made for dealing with the <u>Ravenous Squid-Trees</u><sup>22</sup>?  To overlook them is essentially asking for an accidental genocide.</p>
<p>Finally, I have a question which I have yet to hear a cogent answer to: why not pick an easier road to world peace?  The <u>Zeitgeist Manipulator</u><sup>23</sup> is still operating in orbit around our planet, and demonstrably possesses the power to shape decision-making around the globe.  If you want to see conflict diminished, order an expedition to alter its programming.  By the fact that I can even suggest this, we know that this would be no threat to <u>St. Stafford</u><sup>24</sup>, whose legacy is already secure.  In fact, it would make him the savior of our world once again.</p>
<p>Given all of these reasons, I cannot in good conscience recommend a vote in favor of the Disarrangement Act.  In light of the available evidence, I can see no other conclusion than that implementing the Act would essentially be a form of global suicide&mdash;if a world war does not erupt before we even get that far.  I trust that your wisdom, as responsible world leaders, will enable you to make the right choice.</p>

Nevertheless, though I cannot erase the past, neither can my fall from grace, for despite my revoked credentials I am still a trained computational anthropologist. In this respect, the Disarrangement Act is of great interest to me, since it is both a possibility realized by human technological advancement and the brainchild of <u>the Hegemony of Whales</u><sup>1</sup>, whose race is relatively technologically primitive. In my computational anthropological work, I studied the effect of computers on the development of human culture. Because of this, I feel I have something of interest to say on the Disarrangement Act, and I humbly beg your consideration.</p></div>
<p>The most striking thing about human technological advancement is the interconnectedness it brings. When human civilization was relatively parochial, governments only had to worry about things they could see and <u>the Esoteric Order of Florists</u><sup>2</sup>. Consider how many problems are solved simply by being far away from them. Few people outside of <u>Careless</u><sup>3</sup> mind <u>Joran Lake</u><sup>4</sup>, because the Joranian fauna are (probably) too far away to attack them. Global crises like <u>the War of Durun's Ass</u><sup>5</sup> or the <u>Goats on Boats Affair</u><sup>6</sup> were only possible because naval technology had made it possible for geographically distant problems to reach close to home. Some may claim that these crises were just as much the product of the machinations of the <u>Stratsky Foundation</u><sup>7</sup> or the hotbloodedness of <u>Selestei</u><sup>8</sup>. But consider: would either of these have happened if Selestei or the Compass Republic were geographically isolated from the rest of the world? There's a reason <u>Secretary Tomas</u><sup>9</sup> puts sovereigns in the corner when they misbehave.</p>
<p>The development of the computer is no different. With global networking, anyone across the globe can feel threatened by anything going on anywhere. Before information technology, the average Kingslander didn't have to think about <u>Panark</u><sup>10</sup> authorizing <u>Shaster</u><sup>11</sup> to order <u>Captain Gunnerson</u><sup>12</sup> to take control of the <u>Taurus</u><sup>13</sup> and wipe Kingsland off the map. Now, said Kingslander has to wake up each morning to the distressing fact that they haven't been annihilated from orbit. (They had to before, too, but this just makes it  worse.)</p>
<p>All of this leads me to agree with our esteemed Dr. Hanson that, ultimately, everything goes to shit. If we want to bring about some manner of world peace, drastic measures must be taken, and the Disarrangement Act is exactly the sort of measure we are in desperate need of. As M.Hon. Milton has noted in his article on <u>HEM Seraphi Ironheart</u><sup>14</sup>, one potentially dangerous consequence of the Act is that some unlucky country may become the new neighbor of an irritated HEM Ironheart. But what if <u>Flandre</u><sup>15</sup> was <i>nobody's</i> neighbor? She's <u>dangerous enough to sit next to at Assembly sessions</u><sup>16</sup>, why take any more risk with your own homeland? Let's just put every dangerous country in the middle of the ocean somewhere where they can't hurt anyone. If they need to contact the rest of us, <u>Ulgravian airships</u><sup>17</sup> can carry their letters. I'm sure Flandre would adapt, at least; they've got contingency plans for <u>all sorts of weird things</u><sup>18</sup>, they'd probably like having fewer threats on their borders.</p>
<p>This proposal has historical antecedents that speak in its favor. A little over half a century ago, the completion of <u>the Yggdrasil Project</u><sup>19</sup> ended the conflict between the <u>Vulterbase rebels</u><sup>20</sup> and <u>JUSTICE</u><sup>21</sup>. Since then, have they bothered anybody in the rest of the world? Of course not. The Vulterbase rebels are ensconced behind an impassible combination of <u>squid-trees</u><sup>22</sup> and the Vulterstrom. Imagine a world where any threat to global peace were so ensconced, able to affect the global community only by going through Ulgravian skies. Now that sounds like world peace.</p>
<p>Peace, of course, is not just preventative. Some wrongs of the past must be righted in the new world order. Many sovereigns sit in the Assembly who have little to no land. Surely if they command equal estate in the Assembly chambers, they deserve a little of the estate of the world as well. I think of <u>Incendia</u><sup>23</sup>, Ulgrav, or Panark. Shouldn't we help these countries out and give them some solid ground to stand on? The Selesteines control a lot of land, but they leave <u>Razor Valley</u><sup>24</sup> mostly uninhabited even though they're pretty much the only ones who can make a living there. Why not give some of their safer land to some deserving sovereigns? We could even give some land to <u>Placeholden</u><sup>25</sup>, so we'd finally be able to locate the damn place. This is a chance for justice to prevail, honored sovereigns. Don't let it pass you by!</p>
<p>I thank you again for your consideration, and I hope the Assembly comes to an agreeable consensus on the Disarrangement Act. Unfortunately, I will be unavailable for comment and/or arrest when this Committee's report is presented to the Assembly, as I will be taking a short vacation to go <u>windstriding</u><sup>26</sup> with Dr. Hanson through <u>Yasser's Yells</u><sup>27</sup>. Yasser's got a special deal for windstriding over Vulter I'm eager to take.</p>

<p></p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>The Contagious Republic of Paul Vigotski</h2><p>No one messes with the concept of nationhood like <b>Paul Vigotski</b>.  He's the only person with a seat in the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns who is not actually a Sovereign.  That's because the real Sovereign is the Eubacteriarch, a sentient bacterium that lives in Paul's nasal cavity.  The only academics more fascinated than the biologists are, of course, the memetosociologists, because Paul Vigotski invites the incredibly pressing question "how did this man get recognized as a nation?"</p></div>
<p>According to interviews with the Eubacteriarch, the Contagious Republic of Paul Vitgotski began with a bacterial infection that evolved sentience at the microbial level.  At the time of the Republic's formation, the Republic numbered around 3 million in population.  Each citizen was given one vote, to be shared by the descendants of that citizen after they underwent asexual reproduction.  Nowadays the Contagious Republic's population numbers around 230 trillion, making it the most populous nation on earth.  This makes votes in the Republic a highly scare commodity, often resulting in unrest that manifests as stomachaches.</p>
<p>The Contagious Republic's appearance on the National Stage came at an opportune moment, right as the <u>Very Definitely Independent States</u><sup>1</sup> began their propaganda campaign for independence.  The bacteria of the Republic worked out a way to hijack Vigotski's sensory and motor neurons, allowing for communication between the miniature Republic and the outside world.  In a speech before the Disputatious Assembly, the Eubacteriarch made its case for statehood, appropriating rhetoric used by the VDIS and their allies to all but ensure the support of that bloc.  Therefore, just as the VDIS were granted some dubious measure of statement, the Contagious Republic also managed to win a seat.</p>
<p>Elevating Paul Vigotski to statehood caused no end of political shenanigans.  Foremost of these was Vigotski's status as a citizen of <u>Selestei</u><sup>2</sup>, which made the bacteria's colonization of him technically count as an act of war.  Unfortunately for Selestei, while the Contagious Republic compelled Vigotski to sneeze on every door handle he encountered, the Selesteines could only prosecute the war by forcing Vigtoski to take antibiotics.  Vigotski, who was enjoying the media attention, refused.  The war continued in a subdued sort of manner for three years until both nations attended the <u>Massively Parallel Peace Conference</u><sup>3</sup> and settled on a compromise whereby Vigotski was awarded dual citizenship in both nations.</p>
<p>Today, the Contagious Republic has 32 human citizens, each of which hosts legions of bacterial researchers, artists, and businessgerms.  As such, the Republic's scientific, cultural, and financial output is nearly on par with nations with a much higher human population, and its GDP per capita is the best in the world.</p>

<p>1. The Very Definitely Independent States<br>2. Selestei<br>3. Massively Parallel Peace Conference</p><p>Ah, yes, I remember there was something of a conundrum in the 50's because it seemed like Vigotski himself was getting up there in years.  Everyone was wondering if they'd rename the country after whoever the Eubacteriarch colonized after Vigotski and what would happen to the voting populations that inhabited Vigotski's body.  But it seems like the Republic cracked the secret of cellular regeneration, since Vigotski hasn't aged a day in decades.  Once people figured it out, they were extremely eager to acquire the secret, but the Republic told everyone that they'd need to be colonized for the trick to work.  Interest died out after that.  The older I get, the more I think about taking the offer, but my wife has expressly forbid me from infecting myself just to live forever.  <i>C'est la vie!</i></p>

<p>1. The Roerbach Incident</p><p>The Contagious Republic has probably caused more pain to bureaucrats and paper-pushers than any other country in the Assembly. Their population is several digits wider than any other country's, making it a pain to display in tables. Their ambassadors live inside some of their citizens, making the person of the citizen, properly speaking, the embassy. This means that to mail something to a Vigotskian embassy, one needs the mailing address where the embassy is currently staying. And because they're a nation primarily of microorganisms, instead of singing for their national anthem, they all release a particular mixture of pheromones. Normally, this wouldn't be an issue, except the one time the Disputatious Assembly had to play it before the Eubacteriarch gave a speech. The Assembly notaries had requisitioned a sizable quantity of the pheromones in advance, so they basically just cropdusted the meeting hall with it while he walked up. This is how it was discovered that the Vigotskian national anthem was a truth serum.</p>
<p>The Assembly quickly voted to adjourn until further notice.</p>

<p></p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>The Dark Pentad</h2><p>There was a time when academic institutions would award honorary degrees to individuals who had accomplished great things in the world.  The practice was quite advantageous for both parties; it allowed the university to benefit by associating with an individual of great merit, while the individual gained the status associated with the backing of a university.  But then the practice took a darker turn: in AES 845, the architect and attempted visionary Hans Flugelsson undertook a nationwide project to irrigate his desert homeland of Joran, but made several fatal errors in his calculations.  The results were <u>unfortunate</u><sup>1</sup>, to say the least, and Flugelsson became the recipient of immense ridicule from the international community.  In the midst of this uproar, the University of <u>Shaster</u><sup>2</sup> attempted a publicity stunt by awarding Flugelsson a degree in "Imagineering."</p></div>
<p>The immense positive response to this move led other universities to follow suit whenever public works programs went awry.  The emerging popularity of "dark degrees" was bolstered by the addition of <i>thanatology</i> in 849 for academics whose work led to a large number of deaths and <i>dysthetics</i> in 851 for artists whose work was just terrible.  These became known as the "Dark Triad" until <i>economics</i> was introduced in AES 891, for obvious reasons.  This led to some confusion over what to name these dishonorary degrees, a conversation that would not resolve until the first <i>misosophy</i> degree was awarded in 915 for egregious violations of scholarly norms.</p>
<p>Today, Pentad degrees are most often awarded in-house as the result of some internal investigation of wrongdoing.  While it's not uncommon for academics to accuse each other for political reasons, Pentad degrees are usually conferred only in extreme situations.  (There are <u>exceptions</u><sup>3</sup>, of course.)  Receiving a Pentad degree is typically a deathblow to one's career.  Knowing this, academics have developed complicated social customs built around mitigating the threat of possible accusations.  For example, should a shared research project provoke a Pentad hearing, the second-to-last author on the paper is typically summoned instead of the senior author, thus protecting the careers of established academics.  The scapegoat slot is naturally, therefore, filled by adjunct professors.</p>
<p>Despite the extreme stigma surrounding the Dark Pentad, however, they are each a functioning academic field.  Just like a legitimate academic field, they have journals, conferences, and even <u>advanced degree programs</u><sup>4</sup>.  Mainstream conferences try not to acknowledge Pentad academics, but it is common practice to block out time for "alternate perspectives," which is tacitly understood to be reserved for Pentad pariahs and naive professors who are about to spend the rest of their careers ignorant of why no one wants to co-author any papers with them.</p>

Just as nobody wants to share a room with a leper, for example, no regular academic wants to share an office with a Pentad. So, if you're a Pentad who wants an office, all you really have to do is walk into someone's office and start working there, and they'll quickly make themselves scarce to avoid any association with you. I work at a correspondence university, so we don't even own any buildings &mdash; yeah, yeah, the main campus still exists in the <u>Incendian</u><sup>1</sup> homeland, stuff it &mdash; and yet I've never been lacking for an office, even when I'm only visiting another university for the weekend.

The position fell to her when her husband, the late DAS Secretary Edvard Tomas, fell ill before dying of cancer in AES 981. During the late Secretary's decline in health, his wife increasingly aided him in performing his duties; by the time he died, she was essentially running the Assembly in his name. She proved so adept to the task that nobody wanted to be the one to point out that she had never been officially elected. The Assembly notaries let the situation lie for a year, then decided just to put her election down as unanimous.</p></div>
<p>The main reason for Tomas' success during her tenure as Secretary is her experience dealing with children as a grade school teacher. Normally, international diplomacy has less petty bickering and fewer fistfights, but the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns is anything but normal. It isn't called the <i>Disputatious</i> Assembly for nothing, and not just because <u>Selestei</u><sup>1</sup> is there. Many sovereigns rankle at the condescension displayed at times by the Secretary, but complaining means you lose your gold star for the week, and only those who kept their stars for the month get homemade cookies. Even worse, if you misbehave too much, you get sent to the Time-Out Corner where the sovereigns of <u>the Careless Continent</u><sup>2</sup> are constantly trying to kill each other. This largely keeps the other Sovereigns in order, less because it would be dangerous and more because it would be embarrassing.</p>
<p>The Time-Out Corner doesn't work on everyone, though. The last time Tomas sent King Daggert of Selestei to the Corner, he joined in on the fighting, causing even more of a commotion than before. Conversely, when <u>High Exarch Minor Ironheart</u><sup>3</sup> of <u>Flandre</u><sup>4</sup> was sent to the Corner, the Careless sovereigns sat completely still out of fear of <u>what happened last time</u><sup>5</sup>. The Secretary was so pleased with the result that she returned Ironheart's gold star for the week. Ever since, Assembly staff have suspected that the Secretary is encouraging the High Exarch Minor to cause trouble and get caught so she can be sent to the Corner when the Careless sovereigns are too distracting.</p>
<p>Hand in hand with her fearsome maintenance of Assembly decorum is Tomas' close involvement with the various committees and offices of the Assembly. Very little goes on on campus that she does not know about. She makes a point of sitting in on each committee's official meetings around once a month, as well as observing individual members at work outside of meetings. She's standing behind me right now, in fact. Hello, Secretary Tomas. Yes, I'm getting work done. No, I'm not writing anything bad about you. Sweet, gold star.</p>

<p>I am concerned here particularly in the case of the <b>Double-North Pole</b>, which is a marvel of cartography and civic planning.  Let's begin with the history of this remarkable landmark.  Like anything cartographical, the tale's root can ultimately be found in the <u>Mapmaker's Guild</u><sup>1</sup>.  When the Earth was first completely charted in AES 489, the Venerable Cartographers experienced internal dissension over where to put the compass rose on their maps.  The arguments, I fear, began to turn political, as nationally-aligned factions of the transnational Society began drawing the compass rose over countries they disliked.</p>
<p>While this was going on, a discovery was in the works.  Now, as everyone knows, compasses don't work the same way in <u>the Barcu region</u><sup>2</sup> that they do anywhere else in the world.  But suppose you traveled to Barcu and found north, then traveled somewhere else and found north there.  If you were to draw a line from each of those points, their point of intersection is what we now call the Double-North Pole.  This was first theorized in AES 535 by Iryu Bandan, and confirmed in AES 547 by the famed explorer Vertrad the Swift.</p>
<p>Enter Candor Gunterman, a noble and patron of the Venerable Cartographers.  Wishing to see peace reign at last, he funded a major expedition to the Double-North Pole and founded the city of Bipolaris there.  That city became the seat of the Compass Republic, and they slowly expanded southward to claim more land in the shape of a compass rose, with Bipolaris forming the northern tip.  Gunterman, who remained monarch until AES 597, even had the foresight to shape the country such that it would have the correct proportions on a map using the Herzinger projection.</p>
<p>In recent years, Bipolaris has seen great economic growth as the seat of Sovereign <u>Klaus Santanna</u><sup>3</sup>, whose manufacturing innovations used the surrounding ice fields as heat sinks to massively increase production of goods.  The Double-North Pole's massive outpouring of goods has been aided by an unparalleled distribution network in the form of the <u>Ulgravian zeppelin armada</u><sup>4</sup>, who signed a lucrative trade deal with the Compass Republic in AES 980.</p>

I still don't have any idea how the fuck it got on this zeppelin.  Zeppelin security took like four hours to deal with it, and in the meantime I just had to sit there and think about how much sleep I wasn't getting.  It's been a shitty day.</p></div>
<p>The <b>electric undead</b>, like every horrible thing, hail from the Barcu region.  About fifteen hundred years ago, they started spreading.  The ones that went north froze, and the ones that went south found out the hard way that <u>Flandre</u><sup>1</sup> already had a National Response Protocol for dealing with contagious animated corpses.  But in the east was the warrior kingdom of Hantu.  Don't bother looking them up, they're all zombies now.  The morons found out that the electric undead spread through electrical contact, and all their swords were made of metal, and they <i>still</i> sent everyone at the rotting horde.</p>
<p>Despite the constant menace throughout history, we didn't make any progress understanding what was going on with the electric undead until the turn of the century, when none other than <u>Dr. Stafford</u><sup>2</sup> happened to them.  His research temple captured a few of them and vivisected them with ceramic tools, which allowed them to discover that the electrical activity in their nervous systems was actually <u>antilightning</u><sup>3</sup>, which explained why they act so weird.  Dr. Stafford's research allowed the Disuptatious Assembly of Sovereigns to pass the Electric Undead Quarantine Act.  Initially they wanted to drive the zombies into the sea, but the <u>whales</u><sup>4</sup> weren't having it.  So instead they tried to set up a fucking containment line on the Barcuvian border.  The Flandreans kept trying to set up protective measures, since <i>their</i> government has an entropology research division, but no one else wanted to spend the money and the Hegemon kept blocking them out of spite.</p>
<p>Look no further for proof that the DAS is full of idiots.  We've got this thing in entropology called "Chaos Theory," which is a theory that makes the following prediction: <i>If it causes chaos, it will happen</i>.  So at least none of <i>us</i> were surprised when one day <u>that Fitch fucker</u><sup>5</sup> tried to <u>sneak his students through the containment zone</u><sup>6</sup> and ended up letting all the zombies out into the world.  Now the rest of us have to deal with fucking zombies on our fucking zeppelins disrupting our fucking beauty sleep.  Fuck him.</p>

They are certainly <i>unsettling</i>, given their uncanny ability to deliver flowers anywhere, any time, no matter what security precautions are taken to keep them out. Despite their skill at infiltration dwarfing that of national intelligence agencies, the Order has never been definitively linked to any form of political violence or assassination. This is not to say that the Order has clean hands: it was a campaign of Order deliveries that finally drove the <u>Mad King Westler</u><sup>1</sup> completely insane in the ninth century. Nevertheless, if you're not the sort to be bothered by benign, nigh-omnipresent florists, the Order are at best an inconvenience.</p></div>
<p>The Esoteric Order of Florists is the heir to the Guild of Florists, distinguished as one of two such institutions to survive the decline of the guilds over the early centuries of <i>Anno Ecclesiae Superregum</i>. Like the <u>Mapmakers' Guild</u><sup>2</sup>, the Guild of Florists survived by evolving to transcend the guild system. While the cartographers increasingly militarized to bring the world into line with their maps, the florists developed secret techniques to fulfill more and more audacious contracts. Within the century, their powers of flower delivery had grown so threatening to international security that the Disputatious Assembly ordered countries in which they had guildhalls to implement oppressive controls to curb their power. Eventually, stymieing these measures became so cumbersome that the Guild of Florists announced that it was disbanding and closed all of its locations. There was a worldwide sigh of relief, until every sovereign in the Assembly received a bouquet with a note attached, reading "Thank you for your feedback. Signed, the Esoteric Order of Florists". Nobody knows where they operate out of now, though most suspect <u>Lepazzia</u><sup>3</sup>, their biggest state client, is sheltering them.</p>
<p>The secret to the Order's unmatched infiltration ability has been the subject of interminable debate. They have been suggested to be the keepers of secret cloaking technology discovered long ahead of their time, martial artists whose mastery of ancient <i>jutsu</i> allows them to move as freely and invisibly as the wind, spirits of the forest that can materialize freely in the mortal world, an international network of spies with the connections to get access to anywhere, and the fingers of a dark god breaking through to our world. World leaders such as <u>Klaus Santanna</u><sup>4</sup> have been accused of being Order members hiding in plain sight, and historical figures like <u>Pentex Lannogaster</u><sup>5</sup> are often suspected on account of the breadth of their escapades.</p>
<p>Whatever they are, they are one of the few certainties in life. Every night I lock up the building to clean, and every morning I wake up to the place littered with flower petals. I've tried everything. Nothing works.</p>

<p>I've always felt this story captures both the genius of the Flandrean spirit as well as the tendency for that genius to go wrong in unexpected ways.  And of course the story is in their own words, which I think is the only proper way to learn about a people.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is always room for the perspectives of others, such as the researchers who study the archeological record of the ancient Flandreans.  Flandrean ruins are easy to identify because they're usually chock-full of the remains of primitive booby traps.  Entries in the archeological record indicate that ancient Flandreans originated in the Barcu region before migrating to the territory currently claimed by the Methodocracy of Flandre.  This of course does much to explain the cultural paranoia of Flandre, for if you can't even trust the <u>weather</u><sup>3</sup>, what <i>can</i> you trust?  In fact, some researchers believe ancient Flandreans might have actually invented the concept of government in order to coordinate their contingency plans.</p>
<p>Historically, Flandre has proved a tricky diplomatic partner (see also the <u>Roerbach Incident</u><sup>4</sup>), and the resulting trade deficit limited their economic growth.  It was only with the emergence of the Hegemony of Whales that their economy was able to boom, both as a result of oil trade and of renting space on their oil ships to nations that wish to avoid the Whale Tariffs.  Their cold war with the Hegemony of Whales has positioned them at the center of an anti-whale political bloc, along with the <u>Ulgravian Diaspora</u><sup>5</sup>, whose zeppelin fleet creates an existential need for continued oil trade.</p>

High Exarch Minor Seraphi Ironheart</p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>Flandrean National Response Protocol BX-392a</h2><p>The <b>Flandrean National Response Protocol BX-392a</b>, popularly known as the <b>"Inordinate Number of Snakes" Protocol</b>, is the National Response Protocol (Biological Existential Threat) that replaced NRP BX-392, the "Ordinate Number of Snakes" Protocol. BX-392a was ratified by the <u>High Exarch Minor Seraphi Ironheart</u><sup>1</sup> upon her ascension in AES 990, bringing an end to the civil unrest in which Flandre had become embroiled following High Exarch Cerberus Ironheart's untimely demise in AES 988 at the "hands" of <u>Buddy "Literally Made of Snakes" Johnson</u><sup>2</sup>. Though her detractors launched a protest movement alleging that a twelve-year-old girl couldn't possibly be old enough to understand the correct precautions to take against a large number of snakes, Ironheart proved herself a true daughter of Flandre by having no fewer than three contingency plans prepared for protest movements questioning her competency based on her age, the second of which was later enshrined as National Response Protocol PU-36.</p></div>
<p>Previous Flandrean attempts to define response protocols for various quantities of snakes were limited by available data, as the greatest quantity of snakes the country had ever dealt with occurred during the Snake Rain of AES 954. This event proved the efficacy of the preparations outlined in BX-391, allowing the draft version of BX-392 to be completed and ratified. Yet the number of snakes that fell in the Snake Rain paled in comparison to the inordinate serpentine resources of Buddy Johnson, forcing Flandre, uncharacteristically, to improvise. The desperate, haphazard use of any and all halfway-relevant National Response Protocols led the country to the brink of civil war, necessitating a Protocol that could end the snake menace.</p>
<p>The newly ascended HEM Ironheart, soon to be renowned for her lateral thinking, initially formulated BX-392a after the model of BX-233g, the Protocol dealing specifically with termites resistant to the poisons prescribed in BX-233f. This was met with resistance from the Council of Exarchs on pragmatic grounds, who rejected her proposed plans for the vehicle that would carry the vanguard flamethrowers. In defiance of the Council's opposition, Ironheart formulated an ingenious plan to convince the <u>"Killer Bus"</u><sup>3</sup> of neighboring Kingsland to aid her designs. The Council could not argue with the results and ratified the updated BX-392a.</p>
<p>The success of the new Protocol, no doubt aided by the Killer Bus's longstanding rivalry with "Literally Made of Snakes" Johnson, served to revitalize the Flandrean heavy weapons and cryotechnology industries. The subsequent economic boom has made the High Exarch Minor the darling of her people and cemented her control over the country. This contributes to Flandre's vicious opposition to the Disarrangement Act, which would likely result in Flandre being separated from Kingsland and thus necessitate a reformulation of the "Inordinate Number of Snakes" Protocol's vanguard flamethrower section &mdash; an uneasy prospect for the young sovereign.</p>

<p>1. High Exarch Minor Seraphi Ironheart<br>2. Buddy "Literally Made of Snakes" Johnson<br>3. The Killer Bus of Kingsland North</p><p><u>Flandre's</u><sup>1</sup> massive body of National Response Protocols are organized by topic, with the "X Protocols" defining responses to existential threats. BX protocols specifically address existential threats of a biological nature, like <u>Vigotskian</u><sup>2</sup> invasions or the whales of <u>the Hegemony</u><sup>3</sup> growing legs. Given Buddy "Literally Made of Snakes" Johnson's otherworldly abilities, one may wonder why the Inordinate Number of Snakes Protocol is designated under BX, rather than the fringe NRP designation SX for supernatural existential threats.</p>
<p>The answer is the same as to why Flandre has the National Response Protocols in the first place. Flandreans live within a constant tension between the sanctity of the unrealized future and the certainty of the determined present, and planning for every conceivable contingency is how this is reconciled. The category of the supernatural, however, is the category of that which cannot be anticipated or accounted for, and therefore the Methodocracy is incentivized to keep this category as empty as possible. I'm sure that living near Kingsland also does its fair share of shifting what one considers "natural".</p>

The Fractured Cities are comprised by over fifty eternally bickering city states within a somewhat secluded territory, and all of them are <i>awesome</i>.  Technically the whole mess is one big country, but that's basically just a legal fiction maintained by whatever Hierarch managed to win the last civil war and claim the Sovereignty, and everyone else goes along with it because they don't want to have to deal with a repeat of the whole <u>Very Definitely Independent States</u><sup>4</sup> situation.  Plus you just know that if you brought all fifty-six Hierarchs into the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns, the session would end with two thirds of them dead, a handful of bystander casualties, and the building on fire.</p></div>
<p>The signature cultural activity of the Fractured Cities is called, no shit, a "<u>bloodmoot</u><sup>5</sup>," and it's basically this giant game of assassination chicken where both sides pretend it's a peaceful diplomatic conference until one of them has their assassins shoot first.  But then maybe they find that the assassins were bought off and now they're getting shot in the back.  Or possibly their food had an extra poison besides the one they already took an antidote for and they don't even get to give the signal.  It's possible for neither side to make a move the whole time, of course, but then you've lost because you just sat through a whole diplomatic conference and how long will those agreements stand up in the Fractured Cities anyways?  Television turned the lot of you into brain-rotted zombies, but televised bloodmoots with expert commentary nearly redeem the whole enterprise.</p>
<p>See, entropologists detail two strategies people take to dealing with the inevitable breakdown of all order and goodness.  The first strategy is the one adopted by most modern societies, and it's fucking terrible.  They try and impose order on the natural chaos that is people trying appease their stupid animal brains, and invariably the whole thing grinds itself into disaster and stupidity; see also <u>Incendia</u><sup>6</sup>.  But in the second approach, people embrace chaos and don't pretend like they're better than feral monkeys just because their mating contests are more ambiguous.  That's the approach the Fractured Cities took.  Sure they're at war all the time, but they've been in a pretty stable state of unrest since like a thousand years ago.  Most so-called "organized" nations have collapsed, like, twice in that same time period.  Three times if the Disarrangement Act passes.  You can bet the Fractured Cities will survive that shit.</p>

When the Cetacean Wars broke out in the 920s, he enlisted in the Flandrean military, where his exceptional leadership and near-preternatural ability to anticipate and account for surprises made him rise to the rank of captain by the end of the war. When the Cetacean Wars were ended in 929 by the Assembly's official recognition of <u>the Hegemony of Whales</u><sup>2</sup>, Gorson was quoted as saying, "Let the blowers have the bloody oceans, it'll give 'em somewhere to hide nex' time I come to rip 'em a second hole." Nor was this a mere boast, as Gorson did in fact rip a whale a new blowhole during the Second Battle of Lords' Cove, whence his nickname, "Ripper". His deep and enduring hatred for the whales of the Hegemony has made his name &mdash; or, at least, the whale noises they use to name him &mdash; an expletive in the planet's oceans.</p></div>
<p>Despite his extraordinary success and eventual promotion to the rank of general, Gorson was often sidelined on the national stage because of his fringe views. Like any Flandrean, Gorson was extremely adept at planning for any and every contingency. Unlike his peers, however, Gorson's contingency planning was uncharacteristically <i>preemptive</i>. For Flandre, the future is sacred, and interacting with it must be done receptively. The essential element of Flandrean piety is precisely to let the future happen as it may, and their reverence for it is constituted by planning for it no matter what it brings to pass. Gorson, the only Flandrean officer to execute an ambush that wasn't a counter-ambush, was thus a cultural pariah, because he tried to shape the future actively rather than reactively.</p>
<p>Even though he was kept out of the spotlight, "Ripper" Gorson was still a military genius. He remained a mainstay of the Council of Exarchs, advising the Council on military matters even after his retirement in 973. Sadly, he became somewhat unhinged in his later years, advocating for such policies as helping <u>Selestei</u><sup>3</sup> destroy <u>Zor Olo</u><sup>4</sup>, or declaring war on <u>horseball</u><sup>5</sup> &mdash; not <i>players</i> of horseball, mind you, but the abstract concept of the sport. He died at home in 984 at the age of 81.</p>
<p>A portrait of General Kade "Ripper" Gorson hangs in the Butterfly Effect Advisory Committee's break room, to remind us all of the importance of shaping the future proactively. Personally, ever since the unlikely series of coincidences that landed me in this closet, I've considered him a role model for his perseverance despite being relegated to the fringe.</p>

In the 30s, Gorson's fleet assisted <u>J.U.S.T.I.C.E.</u><sup>1</sup> in offensives against the Vulterbase rebels occupying the <u>xenoarcheological ruins</u><sup>2</sup> at the south pole. His experiences fighting against the rebels' alien-derived technology would later form the basis of his advocacy for arming the <u>Taurus Research Station</u><sup>3</sup>. After the Taurus weaponization, the Hegemony of Whales banned him from the oceans, and Flandre, weighing the options, transferred him from the navy to the army.</p>

It is widely considered to be <u>Flandre</u><sup>2</sup>'s worst political blunder in recorded history—unless you're talking to Dr. Hanson, who tells me entropologists consider it second to the formation of the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns.  But as entropology has yet to create any command narratives whatsoever, I feel we can safely ignore that perspective for the time being.</p></div>
<p>It is important to note that before the Affair began to unfold, the <u>Panark Fleet</u><sup>3</sup> was vying for dominance of global trade.  The modern order of <u>Iurezzan</u><sup>4</sup> economic supremacy was still decades away: the <u>Compass Republic</u><sup>5</sup> had yet to assume its role as a manufacturing giant, while Flandre was still treating its oil stockpile as a strategic reserve rather than a commodity.  With the encroach of ever more powerful naval technologies, maritime exports across the globe became increasingly feasible.</p>
<p>As countries' financial horizons expanded, Sovereigns became increasingly aware that traditional wisdom about trade no longer applied to a progressively more interconnected global economy.  To navigate these new frontiers, most governments set up trade bureaus to assist them in deciding how to handle things like tariffs.  With so much potential wealth to be gained, the vast majority of states saw no problem in sinking sizable fractions of their gross domestic product into shippable goods.  The economists, meanwhile, kept inventing new and exciting ways to extract egregious quantities of wealth from ever more intricate trade schemes.</p>
<p>At the peak of this global boom, a team of economists working out of the <u>National Academy of Velskyavo</u><sup>6</sup> invented a currency exchange system that would allow merchants to increase their profits by routing them through the currencies of multiple nations.  The lynchpin of this system was a "dummy" currency ostensibly backed by the <u>Pseudocracy of Placeholden</u><sup>7</sup>—which, as there was no actual country to back it, could appreciate indefinitely.  The placegilder system was founded on the assumption that all parties involved were rational profit-seeking actors; thus, while the international economics community knew of ways to crash the value of placegilder, it was assumed that no one would be stupid enough to do so, as their own economy would become collateral damage in the process.</p>
<p>The Stratsky Foundation proved them wrong.  But as placegilder crashed and burned, Flandre enacted a contingency plan to shunt the value of placegilder into livestock.  Unfortunately, this plan relied on convincing every other state to adopt certain tariff practices, and at this time Flandre—not possessing the political clout they hold today—was seen as a weird paranoid nation on the fringe of the national stage.  Tariffs on livestock were raised instead, and the Panark Fleet ended up overflowing with herds of goats they couldn't afford to unload. 
 Making matters worse, <u>Selestei</u><sup>8</sup> responded by declaring war on livestock.  With livestock in every country on the globe, the global community began to fear another <u>War of Durun's Ass</u><sup>9</sup>.  But on the brink of a world war, <u>Shaster</u><sup>10</sup> sent in a crack diplomatic team with steak dinners, and peace was preserved until the eruption of the first Cetacean War in 920.</p>

All that heavybeer puts them on quite another level indeed!  But even your average Selesteine would be well advised not to arm-wrestle a <b>Grim Weeper</b>, for in the heat of the moment they might forget themselves and beat you to death with your own arm.</p></div>
<p>The defining characteristic of the Grim Weepers has always been their custom of eating painfully spicy food to carry them through battle.  With modern medical knowledge, researchers think they derive two benefits from this.  First, the pain releases a surge of adrenaline, amplifying their already-formidable strength.  Second, overwhelming oneself with pain helps both to prepare you for injuries in battle and to distract you from those injuries once they occur.  There are even recorded instances where a Grim Weeper's spicy breath alone incapacitated weaker foes.  However, <u>Pentex Lannogaster</u><sup>2</sup>—himself a Grim Weeper and veteran of <u>The War of Durun's Ass</u><sup>3</sup>—writes in his memoirs that the practice of eating spicy food arose from tribal contests of the ancient Selesteines, whose strongest warriors would eat spicy food until someone gave up.  In his words, "Pain is God's way of telling you to man up."</p>
<p>Historically, the Grim Weepers were always the vanguard of the Selesteine military, their distinctive greatswords being well-suited to cleaving through an enemy's front line.  This strategy was most effective against the footsoldier-based armies of the <u>Fractured Cities</u><sup>4</sup>, but the Selesteine love of a challenge also saw the Grim Weepers charging <u>Ulgravian cavalry lines</u><sup>5</sup> (against whom they fared relatively well) and <u>Incendian</u><sup>6</sup> fire bellows (which, unfortunately for them, were hotter than their peppers).  During the reign of <u>Mad King Westler</u><sup>7</sup>, there was also an attempt to invade the <u>Panark Fleet</u><sup>8</sup>, but they found to their shame that they could not swim fast enough to reach the boats.  Many lives were lost that day.</p>
<p>Sadly, the tides of history have not been kind to the Selesteine model of war, and the Grim Weepers have borne that decline worse than other sectors of the Selesteine military.  The invention of gunpowder-based projectile weaponry turned more than one of their would-be glorious charges into massacres.  There was a brief time in AES 927 when Selestei tried making their swords even larger to block bullets, but the soldiers themselves rejected the new swords on the grounds that it was shameful for a true warrior to cower behind their own weapon.</p>
<p>In AES 971, the Department of Glory (their military branch) finally gave in and changed the strategic role of the Grim Weepers.  In the repertoire of modern states, pitched battles are giving way to precision tactical operations.  The modern Grim Weepers now resemble the special operations forces of any other military, except with capsaicin pills and giant broadswords strapped to their backs.  Though this has significantly increased their survival rate, it has also revealed an epidemic of <u>Jalapeñosis</u><sup>9</sup> among the older Grim Weepers.  Only time will tell their if defining practice will continue into the future.</p>

<p>The first hard light projection was developed in early 958 by <u>Vigotskian</u><sup>1</sup> researchers at the National University of <u>Incendia</u><sup>2</sup> and had the ability to project a three-dimensional hologram in space. The research paper simply called it a "light projector", but the university's branding office insisted that it be called <i>hard</i> light projection in the press releases and distinguished from "easy light projection", what screen projectors do.</p>
<p>As is normal with academicians, this kicked off a flurry of activity seeking to capitalize on both the new research and the spate of media attention. The National University of <u>Shaster</u><sup>3</sup> was the first to respond, putting forth a prototype in late 959 that could project a hologram at long distances. The NUS Dean of Engineering declared this achievement to be the <i>real</i> hard light projection, and "what those Typhoid Marys coughed up" to be merely <i>easy</i> light projection. They were one-upped a month later by The Grim College, which (literally) extended their work to project light around the curvature of the planet. This, the High Inquisitor declared, was the <i>truly</i> hard light projection, and all this merely <i>straight</i> projection was so easy it could barely be called light projection at all.</p>
<p>Not to be outdone, Warbaum's University sought a new direction for projection technology. In 966, its Department of Physics and Cooking revived the dispute by releasing a light projector that could create <i>solid</i> holograms. This, the Professor Chefmaster declared, was the only light projection that could truly be considered hard, and the intepretation of "hard" as referring to difficulty was a misdirection by amateurish charlatans. The Selesteine College of Arts and Zymurgy saw an opportunity here for publicity in a field they did not even have a department for and declared that Warbaum's allegedly hard light projection could not stand up to the merest flick by a <u>Grim Weeper</u><sup>4</sup>. Therefore, it could be considered <i>soft</i> light projection at best. Capitalizing on this in turn, <u>Razor Valley</u><sup>5</sup> Bunker-University revealed a form of light projection with alcohol content a few years later, and declared <i>this</i> to be the true "hard" light projection.</p>
<p>By 974, the Incendian homeland became inaccessible, and the Incendian President Iyano Niir was the only one left on the succession list for the Dean of NUS. Rebranding the university as the National Correspondence University of Incendia, he brought a paradigm shift to hard light projection technology by paying dictionary publishers to make "hard" short for "hardtack", the cracker. Armed with stacked dictionaries and a pedanticism born of desperation, Niir attended ProjExpo 975 and unveiled a lamp with hardtack taped over the bulb, which he claimed projected "hard[tack] light". For making a mockery of the field, Niir was immediately thrown out of the convention and given an official warning from <u>J.U.S.T.I.C.E.</u><sup>6</sup></p>

While the former was an academic venture of international proportions, the latter was a dispute that occurred between the Left Physics Department and the Right Physics Department of Kera University. The former produced a prototype hard light projector with a user interface so arcane that it was nigh-impossible to use, and offered this as a contribution to the debate over what could be considered hard light projection. The latter objected, claiming that neither the projection nor the light was hard, and drove its point home by creating a slide projector out of titanium and bashing the Left Physics Department's prototype to pieces. This resulted, as is typical at Kera University, in a semester-long campaign of vengeance.</p>

<p></p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>The Hegemony of Whales</h2><p><b>The Hegemony of Whales</b> is the largest country in the world and <i>per se</i> the largest voting bloc in the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns. Recognized by the Assembly in AES 929 following the Cetacean Wars of the 920s, the hyperintelligent whales of the Hegemony lay claim to all of the planet's oceans as their sovereign territory, covering more than two-thirds of the surface. Through a quirk of wording in the Assembly's charter, voting power is described in terms of <i>seats</i>; the Hegemon, therefore, whose girth takes up an entire wing of seats, possesses nearly a third of the votes, depending on how massive the current occupant of the position is. (It is not a coincidence that this precipitated the breakup of the Union into the <u>Very Definitely Independent States</u><sup>1</sup>, nor that the Hegemony was the first to ratify the States each receiving a seat.) The admission of the Hegemony caused a fundamental change in the politics of the Assembly, which was allowed to happen when the first Hegemon, Bueoueou the Great, threatened to roll over the opposition. While the Assembly's sudden change of policy towards ocean preservation was the first and most obvious effect, more subtle consequences were to follow.</p></div>
<p>Though the Hegemony is an axis of international politics, it lacks a strong economic base, being entirely underwater. The hyperintelligent whales, while hyperintelligent, are whales, and thus lack the fine motor control required for most skilled professions. In order to make the Hegemony an economic power on par with its political power, Hegemon Aouwouou instituted the Whale Tariffs, a tax on all ships passing through Hegemony territory, i.e. the oceans. This had wide-reaching economic effects, the most notable of which was the ascension of <u>Flandre</u><sup>2</sup> as an economic powerhouse. Because Flandre's economy is mostly oil-based, the High Exarch was able to equip every ship in the Flandrean fleet with significant amounts of oil, effectively turning the Hegemony's threat to sink noncompliant ships into mutually assured destruction. This defiance to the Whale Tariffs has put them at the center of the Assembly bloc that forms the main opposition to the Hegemon's vote. It has not been a <i>carte blanche</i> resistance, however; after the weaponization of the <u>Taurus Research Station</u><sup>3</sup>, the Hegemony banned <u>General Gorson</u><sup>4</sup> from sea travel, which Flandre wisely heeded.</p>
<p>The Hegemony of Whales proposed the Disarrangement Act in AES 989 in advance of the Assembly's millenial. The Hegemony's reasons for the Act are not difficult to infer: rearranging all the countries in the world will undoubtedly require shipping some of them to different continents, an unimaginably profitable opportunity for the Hegemony. It also stands to neutralize the threat Flandre poses to it, as long as Flandre's new location has less oil in it.</p>

The Ulgravian Diaspora</p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>High Exarch Minor Seraphi Ironheart</h2><p>In the <u>Methodocracy of Flandre</u><sup>1</sup>, it is not just the strong who survive.  The strong are often overconfident, so they don't prepare enough for eventual failure.  Flandreans instead celebrate the <i>crafty</i>, who so often bring down the strong,  and Flandrean institutions reflect that fact faithfully.</p></div>
<p>Methodocracy, or "rule by schemes," is by design a difficult-to-understand system of government.  In fact, many of the protocols of the Methodocracy are kept confidential to prevent exploitation by external or internal powers.  However, it is known that the High Exarch is chosen not on the basis of any personal merit, but based on whether their proposed solution to the current national crisis is more effective than the others.  Nominally this would include a proposal from the current High Exarch, but High Exarchs have a habit of coincidentally winding up dead whenever a situation rises to the level of a national crisis.</p>
<p>You can read more about <b>High Exarch Minor Seraphi Ironheart</b>'s ascension in Dr. Rubric's <u>treatment</u><sup>2</sup> of the Inordinate Number of Snakes protocol, but my topic here is Ironheart's conduct as High Exarch Minor.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, the case of a 12-year-old whose defense proposal was rejected by the Council.  For most little girls, that would be the end of their political endeavors, for that is the way society tells them that the process works.  Soon-to-be-HEM Ironheart instead traveled north to Kingsland—foolhardy in its own right—persuaded an <u>eldritch abomination</u><sup>3</sup> to participate in her scheme, and then barbecued half the Council with a flamethrower while riding atop said eldritch abomination.  Rubric writes "they could not argue with the results"—indeed, indeed!  It was a brilliant political move, for not only did she demonstrate the worthiness of her proposal, but she also boldly demonstrated that the Council didn't have a contingency plan for getting baked alive.</p>
<p>Now 14, Ironheart's leadership has remained no less decisive or flashy.  Most controversial, of course, was her decision to establish a military base on the lip of the <u>Missing Sea</u><sup>4</sup> as a foothold for research and colonization.  Ironheart correctly identified that Flandre was the only nation in a position both to exploit the resources on the open sea floor and to stave off the wrath of the whales that would follow such a course.  And the public relations strategies she employed to address, mollify, rebut, and/or disappear her detractors once again demonstrate the deftness of her contingency planning.</p>
<p>While there are several obvious reasons of practicality underlying Flandre's resistance to the Disarrangement Act, proponents of the Act might consider that they do not want an irritated High Exarch Minor Seraphi Ironheart on their borders.</p>

<p>1.

The <u>988 snake invasion</u><sup>2</sup>, therefore, became a matter of international concern, not only because it threw the Flandrean-headed anti-whale coalition into disarray, but also because the succession crisis threatened to bring Seraphi to power much earlier than anticipated. With Flandre's coalition leaderless, <u>the Very Definitely Independent States</u><sup>3</sup>, still smarting from Seraphi's machinations, motioned for the Assembly to respond by annihilating <i>both</i> sides of the civil war. The rest of the whale bloc gave its support, fearing the prospect of a recovered Flandre under a High Exarch Minor Ironheart. Flandre was at its most vulnerable, and if they did not strike while they had the chance, having another would be doubtful. The shaken coalition, on the other hand, feared the prospect of the whale bloc figuratively (or literally) rolling over them, and the ensuing political deadlock lasted long enough that Seraphi Ironheart could ascend as High Exarch Minor and settle the matter in the Assembly herself.</p>

I submitted an official complaint to have someone else take over the 988 BEAC so it wouldn't be slowed down, but nothing came of it, and the point was moot when Seraphi Ironheart was coronated. Shortly thereafter, I had an unlikely series of very unfortunate coincidences, leaving me in my current position.

<p></p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>High Illuminator Saint Doctor Heinrich Stafford</h2><p>Historians have said that is impossible to overestimate the legacy of <b>Dr. Heinrich Stafford</b>.  Few historical figures have so many achievements to their name or are spoken of with such praise, though of course they lack the distinction of <u>having those opinions broadcast worldwide</u><sup>1</sup>.  Devices designed by the illustrious Dr. Stafford can be found at the root of most modern technological innovations, and it seems the man could not order a sandwich without founding a revolutionary academic discipline.  I exaggerate, but not by much: my own field, miscellania, was created after Dr. Stafford rearranged his office file cabinet in AES 923.</p></div>
<p>Born in AES 888—an auspicious year in his native Flandre—the future internationally-acclaimed genius quickly demonstrated himself to be in an intellectual class above his peers and even his instructors.  In the sometimes cutthroat environment of Flandrean academics, this put something of a target on the young Stafford.  However, the pressure from his would-be peers desisted after he tricked three students and a professor into their respective booby traps.  The academic credentials of the professor, one Dr. Sandra Anderson, were automatically bequeathed to Stafford in accordance with the then-recently passed Petard Forfeiture Laws.  This resulted in him taking a professorship at the age of 17, shortly afterward publishing his first paper on the <u>electric undead</u><sup>2</sup> in AES 905.</p>
<p>Dr. Stafford's subsequent accomplishments are, of course, a matter of historical record.  Particularly noteworthy are his invention of <u>asynchronous energy theory</u><sup>3</sup> in AES 908; solving the location of every <u>fixed-point cube</u><sup>4</sup> in AES 911; adapting the rules of <u>Horseball</u><sup>5</sup> in AES 920; and the invention of <u>computational theology</u><sup>6</sup> in AES 923, for which he was sainted, in addition to receiving the unique distinction of "High Illuminator," a title meant to reflect his status as the highest bringer of knowledge to our humble species.  I shan't spend much time on these topics here, as as they have been extensively covered in my colleagues' excellent articles about them.  I will note, however, that you will find much of Dr. Stafford's work was ultimately accomplished by other people, as the man himself was too busy inventing other revolutionary ideas to build a proof of concept for his earlier revolutionary ideas.</p>
<p>A celebrated public figure and undoubtedly a man who single-handedly changed humanity's course through the heavens, Dr. Stafford left us one winter eve in AES 939.  According to the official reports&mdash;which, it must be said, are Flandrean government documents, so take this with as much salt as you like&mdash;Dr. Stafford had been researching the <u>Missing Sea</u><sup>7</sup> to uncover metaphysical secrets of the universe.  His hope was reportedly to transcend to a higher plane of being, a hope which is not all that far-fetched when you consider the <u>sorts</u><sup>8</sup> of <u>things</u><sup>9</sup> which may be found in Kingsland.  Whatever device he may have constructed has never been found; however, it is incontrovertible that Dr. Stafford was never seen again.  Still, there are many&mdash;myself included&mdash;who like to keep a picture of him on our desks, and whisper a little prayer every time we submit a paper for publication.  Just in case.</p>

The sport grew out of an <u>Ulgravian</u><sup>1</sup> pastime, from before the country took to the skies, where mounted warriors would tie their shields concave-out to their hands and toss a ball to each other. The rules of horseball have been thoroughly systematized since those days, with glove size regulated and ball make standardized. Most institutions of secondary education will take their classes on a field trip to a horseball course, and many post-secondary institutions have horseball teams that bring in fans and provide scholarships.</p></div>
<p>Competitive horseball has been praised as uniting the venerable practice of horse breeding with the fast-paced action of other ball-type team sports, while retaining those qualities that allow fans to participate in the collective identity of their college, city, or country. Professional horseballers are widely regarded as celebrities. Because it requires a horse, of course, standard horseball is not a common leisure activity. Fans wanting to play it themselves will generally run around sans horse, ride on the shoulders of another player, or use roller skates. Rarely, amateur horseball is played on motorcycles, which is generally discouraged by the International Horseball Council (IHC).</p>
<p>While <u>Selestei</u><sup>2</sup> does know of a sport by the name "horseball", it is not the same sport as played in the rest of the world. Instead of players on horses passing around a ball, Selesteine horseball involves players passing around a horse rolled up into a ball. Selesteine horseball teams are allowed to compete in the same brackets as international horseball teams through a byzantine set of adapter rules composed by <u>the peerless Dr. Stafford</u><sup>3</sup>. Inexplicably, the matchup is quite balanced.</p>
<p>This benevolence came back to bite the international horseball community when Selestei won its first World Trough in 933. In the ensuing chaos of their victory/national anthem, the Selesteine team rolled the opposing team's horses into a giant ball and threw it into the audience. Inspired by this, Johnson, Johnson, & Several Other Johnsons, an <u>Incendian</u><sup>4</sup> <u>mad lawyer cabal</u><sup>5</sup>, delved into Stafford's adapter rules and produced an extensively cross-referenced report a week later arguing that this was a legal move in adapted horseball. The 934 horseball season was subsequently dominated by the so-called "Selsroll" strategy until the IHC's own legal team could deconstruct JJ&SOJ's argument and restore a modicum of sensibility to the sport.</p>
<p>Selestei seems to be the only country to have gotten away with such an egregious perversion of the rules. When the <u>Lepazzian</u><sup>6</sup> team's goal was suddenly found to have been <u>filled with flowers</u><sup>7</sup> last year, preventing the other team from scoring, the Lepazzian team was politely asked to withdraw and suggested to refrain from entering for the next year.</p>

One vendor in the 934 season rolled a bunch of meat into a ball, baked it in a pastry shell, and sold it as a "Selsroll". The timing was perfect and it became a hit with horseball fans. This was all well and good until an internal memo of the IHC was leaked, revealing ongoing discussions to host a horseball tournament in which the losing team's horses would be ground up and made into selsrolls to be enjoyed by the winning team and their fans. This dealt a severe blow both to the IHC's credibility and selsroll vendors, both of which took years to recover.</p>

Then read 'em and fucking weep, because either you don't know about the <b>I'll Legislate it, I Swear, Don't Think I Won't Act</b>, or your TV-rotted excuse for a brain is in too much of a stupor to understand the implications.</p>
<p>The ILIISDTIWA is, simply put, the nadir of not just the Assembly, but also of <i>civilization in general</i>.  It started with some wag deciding to curb the power of the <u>Esoteric Order of Florists</u><sup>2</sup>, never mind that all they do is deliver fucking flowers to hard-to-reach areas, and never mind that if your jumped-up, fancy-pants "national security" can't stop a bunch of florists there's no way they'll listen when a gaggle of politicians tells them off for it.  Whatever.  Tale as old as time.</p>
<p>So next thing that happens is people start adding on all these other riders to the Act.  And I'll give them this: the founders of the Assembly knew this was going to be a problem, so there are provisions in the Charter that force people to remain at least notionally on topic when they try to stick their overbearing regal genitals in a piece of legislation.  But look at the fucking title on this piece of shit!  Can you think of anything you <i>can't</i> legislate with a title like that?  "Hur hur, what about legislating not thinking they won't" <i>no dice, you corpulent weasel, the fuckers did that too</i>.</p>
<p>Even the shit that went wrong didn't go right, because the Assembly is full of opportunists who want to find a nice, convenient legislative vehicle to outlaw their favorite pet peeve.  The I'll Legislate It Act opened the floodgates on a tsunami of excrement.  There were sections that outlawed voting with your left hand, and lunchtime, and famously even <i>other sections of the same fucking Act</i>.  And so of course it got to the point where nobody actually wanted this legislative atrocity to go through, because their own citizens would have them drawn and quartered.  But they had also spent way too many favors getting this thing set up, so they couldn't vote against.  So on voting day, one by one, every stinkin' Sovereign in the building voted to abstain.  But they forgot one critical detail: <u>Lepazzia</u><sup>3</sup> always votes in favor.</p>
<p>I don't wanna think about this anymore, so I'm gonna get shitfaced.  Smell ya later.</p>

<p>1. The Roerbach Incident<br>2. The Esoteric Order of Florists<br>3. Lepazzia</p><p><u>The Hegemony of Whales</u><sup>1</sup>, as expected, blamed the passage of the Act on <u>Flandre</u><sup>2</sup>, but the charge isn't entirely groundless. Flandre, after all, was at the very end of the voting order, just after Lepazzia. As each sovereign abstained from the vote, there was a growing sense that if Lepazzia didn't break their streak to abstain with every other sovereign, there wouldn't be any votes left to stop them. Yet the sovereigns right before Lepazzia, on whom the pressure increasingly mounted, were all countries that had put too much into the Act, and one by one they abstained in the hope that either Lepazzia would do something sensible or Flandre, always prepared, would stop them. When Lepazzia casually voted for the Act as if it were any other motion, all breath stopped and all eyes turned to High Exarch Ironheart. Ironheart rose slowly, looked around the room, and abstained.</p>
<p>The room was silent for only a moment before turning into an outright riot, with half the room charging the High Exarch and the other half fighting among themselves. The High Exarch, of course, immediately disappeared into the escape tunnel beneath his seat. The Secretary attempted to restore order, but one of the stipulations of the Act, courtesy of <u>the Careless Continent</u><sup>3</sup>, prohibited the Secretary from stopping fights in the Assembly for the first week after its passage.</p>

<p>1. The Hegemony of Whales<br>2. Flandre<br>3. The Careless Continent</p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>Incendia</h2><p><b>Incendia</b> was and allegedly still is a prosperous city-state on the northern border of <u>Lepazzia</u><sup>1</sup>. In AES 972, in the face of increasing pressure from <u>the Hegemony of Whales</u><sup>2</sup>, Incendia massively scaled up efforts to harvest the country's rich oil deposits. This brought great prosperity to Incendia with a rapidity aided by a disregard for an accompanying Flandrean level of contingency planning. As a result, the entire country collapsed into a giant sinkhole during the 974 Open Flame Festival, the inauspicious timing of which ignited the gas deposits, creating the still-burning conflagration we know today.</p></div>
<p>At the time of the Festival, Incendia's president, Iyano Niir, was at a session of the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns. The <u>Ulgravian</u><sup>3</sup> sovereign motioned to have Niir dismissed from the Assembly, on the grounds that because Incendia no longer existed, he was no longer a sovereign; the motion was, as usual, seconded by Lepazzia. President Niir's subsequent defense of his continued presence is widely considered one of the greatest orations given in the Assembly this century. According to Niir, Incendia had only been mildly perturbed by the multiple-story drop into the sinkhole, and hadn't been destroyed in the slightest. The perpetual fire that now burned in the pit where his country once was, he scoffed, was not the burnoff of their gas deposits, but rather what their national festivals looked like from above. He exhorted those who sought to remove him from the Assembly to desist from their cultural myopia and recognize the heritage of Incendia and their peculiar means of celebration. To any who persisted, he challenged them to go to Incendia themselves and prove that there wasn't a country underneath the roiling curtain of flame, though he warned that the country was very welcoming and visitors might find themselves unable to leave. The subsequent vote to eject Incendia from the Assembly narrowly failed, thanks to the intervention of the Hegemon of Whales, though Niir was unable to stop the Assembly's notaries from subtracting the sinkhole's area from Incendia's officially recorded landmass.</p>
<p>Today, Incendia remains in somewhat of a precarious position. President Niir currently lives off of the complimentary snacks provided at Assembly breakout sessions and sleeps in the Butterfly Effect Advisory Committee's break room, because it has the softest couch. Every now and then the Committee chases him out, but I can hear him snoring in the air ducts from the basement, and he's always back by the end of the week. The Incendian military, Gregor Gregory, is currently stationed in their embassy in <u>the Panark Fleet</u><sup>4</sup>. The Incendian military being entirely stationed inside another country is the cause of some international tension, which Niir insists is "not a big deal, and besides, Gregor's very agreeable." The Incendian Tourism Bureau continues Niir's foreign policy by publishing pamphlets about how much Indencians love festivals that obscure the country from above, but its suggested travel destinations are all Incendian embassies in other countries, which have set up farms and become self-sufficient on their small plots of land.</p>

<p></p><p>For a country with an inordinate number of fire-based cultural traditions, Incendia ran a very tight ship as a safety and storage guarantor. All sorts of historical documents were stored in the Incendian vaults, including the original copies of the <u>Ulgravian</u><sup>1</sup> land lease documents. This, of course, came to an end with the 974 collapse. Incendia's remaining <u>mad lawyer</u><sup>2</sup>, Parvus the Litigator, attempted to use this to have the land lease contract nullified in order to ward off any future Ulgravian retribution. After a hurried consultation by President Niir, Parvus mad-lawed himself into being the defense lawyer and began arguing the official Incendian position that the homeland had not been destroyed, and therefore there was no breach of the contract. This resulted in a schizophrenic trial in which Parvus viciously argued at length with himself in front of a confused judge. When he began to lose the defending case, he resorted to personal attacks against the plaintiff (i.e. himself), until the trial degenerated into a fistfight in which he put himself in a headlock and choked himself out. The judge, unsure of what had just happened, threw the case out. This may have been the Litigator's plan all along, however, because the Assembly courts are now turned off from touching anything related to the legal status of Incendia.</p>

Mad legal practice</p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>Iurezza (continent)</h2><p>The continent of <b>Iurezza</b> is one of five continents, the others being the <u>Careless Continent</u><sup>1</sup>, <u>Vulterland</u><sup>2</sup>, <u>Benri</u><sup>3</sup>, and Ciphan.  I have always thought it is shaped vaguely like a massive, inverted pear.</p></div>
<p>Here is a list of things in Iurezza that might be relevant to the Disarrangement Act:</p>
<p>• The Compass Republic, whose sovereign <u>Klaus Santanna</u><sup>4</sup> runs a global trade network with the help of the <u>Ulgravian Diaspora</u><sup>5</sup>.</p>
<p>• <u>High Exarch Minor Seraphi Ironheart</u><sup>6</sup>, on whom my esteemed colleague M. Hon. Milton has written an excellent comprehensive report.  I note for the attentive reader that the High Exarch Minor, though usually located on Iurezza, is not necessarily to be found there at all times.</p>
<p>• Ironheart's country, the Methodocracy of Flandre, whose combination of <u>near-limitless energy</u><sup>7</sup> and rich oil reserves allows them to fuel the Ulgravian zeppelin fleet and protect their trade ships from aggression by <u>the Hegemony of Whales</u><sup>8</sup>.</p>
<p>• The historical remains of no less than twelve <u>Selesteine</u><sup>9</sup> invasions, including those from the <u>War of Durun's Ass</u><sup>10</sup>, the <u>Roerbach Incident</u><sup>11</sup>, and the <u>Goats on Boats Affair</u><sup>12</sup>.</p>
<p>• <u> </u><sup>13</sup></p>
<p>• My apologies for the length of the preceding bullet point—there's just so much to say!</p>
<p>• The headquarters of the <u>Venerable Society of Cartographers</u><sup>14</sup>, whose increasing militarization has lead also to increasing tensions with their host state, Flandre.</p>
<p>• <i>Several</i> species of bird.</p>
<p>• Technically, if one goes by the seating conventions of the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns, the <u>Pseudocracy of Placeholden</u><sup>15</sup> is located somewhere around here (N.B. no one has ever figured out where their national borders are supposed to go).</p>
<p>• The Barrowlands, ruled by Sornhandr, the King Eternal.  The <u>inexplicably perpetual cloudiness</u><sup>16</sup> of the country makes it difficult to figure out what exactly goes on in there, but distance observation by Flandrean expeditions indicate that the observable parts of the country are just stretches of ancient barrows with no living thing in sight.  I regret to say that my wife has forbidden me to explore it.</p>
<p>• The city-state of Kingsland, with its terrified inhabitants and the beings that they <u>worship and/or flee from</u><sup>17</sup>.  I would write more on them here, but the last time I wrote a monograph on Kingsland religion and culture I accidentally summoned some kind of spider demon (not to be confused with their <u>snake demon</u><sup>18</sup>) and it took forever to get the building repaired.</p>
<p>• The "dead zone," a no man's land (since the <u>Night of Storms</u><sup>19</sup>, anyways) historically ravaged by the <u>electric undead</u><sup>20</sup>.</p>
<p>I hope you find this list useful.  Enjoy the deliberations!</p>

A neometal classical band out of the <u>Very Definitely Independent States</u><sup>1</sup>, they took their name from an AES 840 incident where the Benric Sovereign sneezed on Sornhandr, the King Eternal, and was fatally cursed for the faux pas.  The phrase has come to refer to all the ways life's endeavors can suddenly come to an end because of small mistakes, and SotKE's music presents that ethos perfectly.  This can be seen in their 961 <b><i>Iurezza</i></b>, a nearly three-hour concept album telling the story of the rise and eventual fall of the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns.  Written mostly by their drummer, my old mentor Professor Riggs Behemon, the story contains more historical research than some PhD theses.</p></div>
<p><b>1.  <u>The Partitioning</u><sup>2</sup> (Instrumental)</b> — 5:23</p>
<p><i>The Partitioning</i> is an overture meant to represent the division of the world into nation-states.  Vocalist Gen Oslif has said in interviews that SotKE considers division between people to be the root of all strife.  There is some wisdom to this, I think.</p>
<p><b>2.  Origination</b> — 12:02</p>
<p>SotKE introduce the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns in its original form as a social club created by High Exarch <u>Jain Kantamon</u><sup>3</sup> to keep tabs on the local leaders of consequence.  In those days, the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns did not possess the power it holds today, and only affected that part of the world that could travel there.  The track is notable for incorporating passages from the <u>Book of Schemes</u><sup>4</sup> into the lyrics.</p>
<p><b>3.  Here There Be Dragons</b> — 17:49</p>
<p>A heavy, grinding epic about the Roerbach Incident, featuring an excellent duet between Kantamon (Oslif) and Doric Foeslayer (guitarist Enric Hass) about what they respectively think is happening.  For a brief period in the 60's, this was the only scholarly source that argued Doric Foeslayer knew what was going on.</p>
<p><b>4.  Interlude: A Shrinking Sandbox (Instrumental)</b>  — 3:25</p>
<p>This instrumental is about the expanding diplomatic frontiers of the Assembly as continued exploration of the world increased the number of Sovereigns who could attend Assembly sessions.</p>
<p><b>5.  The King Eternal</b> — 7:56</p>
<p>This track introduces Sornhandr, the King Eternal, as a symbol of the end of all things.  In a nod to their longtime fans, this track reprises key riffs from "Sneezing on the King Eternal," a track from their debut album.  I always get the chorus stuck in my head: "Withered hand <u>the lighting brings</u><sup>5</sup> / Bow to the Eternal King."</p>
<p><b>6.  The Glory</b> — 15:11</p>
<p>Track 6 covers the age of <u>Selesteine</u><sup>6</sup> dominance of international politics (roughly c. 250 to 382).  Global force projection was not possible back in those days due to logistical capabilities, but Selestei had the closest thing.  The track concludes with "bad neighbors from the <u>east</u><sup>7</sup>" landing their country on Selestei's shores, ending their naval force projection.</p>
<p><b>7.  Acceleration</b> — 16:43</p>
<p><i>Acceleration</i>, which gets faster over the course of the song, tells the story of the growing technological capabilities of Assembly member nations and the resulting increase of relevance of the Assembly to global politics.</p>
<p><b>8.  Ascension</b> — 8:47</p>
<p><i>Ascension</i> briefly addresses <u>Ulgrav's</u><sup>8</sup> taking to the skies, as seen through the perspective of the Assembly.</p>
<p><b>9.  The Glory (Reprise)</b> — 10:34</p>
<p>This track portrays the <u>War of Durun's Ass</u><sup>9</sup> as a Selesteine attempt at one last feat of heroism before history sweeps their way of life away.  I get chills whenever I hear the last verse:</p>
<p><i>We will set sail for the glory</i><br>
<i>One last time, we raise our blades</i><br>
<i>Let the world tell them our story</i><br>
<i>History will know our names</i></p>
<p><b>10.  Interlude: The System of the World (Instrumental)</b> — 11:37</p>
<p>This track, which is supposed to represent the Assembly attaining the status and power it holds today, contains an 8-minute solo by guitarist Kela Reardon.</p>
<p><b>11.  War Upon the Deep</b> — 20:12</p>
<p>This track addresses both the <u>Goats on Boats Affair</u><sup>10</sup> and the Cetacean War, its resolution, and the geopolitical fallout of recognizing the <u>Hegemony of Whales</u><sup>11</sup> into the Assembly.  Attentive listeners will hear echoes of "The King Eternal" in parts of the track.</p>
<p><b>12.  Here There Be Dragons (Reprise)</b> — 6:13</p>
<p>With their typical propensity for rich metaphors, SotKE argue in this track that the increasing complexity of modern life has introduced many existential threats to the world, and that Assembly politics will inevitably lead to someone triggering one of them.</p>
<p><b>13.  Annihilation</b> — 39:16</p>
<p>In the epic, final track of the album, SotKE paint a picture of the return of the <u>Ultimate Dragonopolis</u><sup>12</sup> resulting in the destruction of sentient life.  Given the stated intentions of <u>certain individuals</u><sup>13</sup>, one can't help but worry that their fears might be prophetic.  The track ends with a beautiful, organ-only reprise of The King Eternal, inviting us all to contemplate our transience in this life.</p>

<p></p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>Jalapeñosis</h2><p>Historically, the <u>Grim Weepers</u><sup>1</sup>, <u>Selestei's</u><sup>2</sup> elite shock troops, ate extremely spicy food before going into battle. Because they were the vanguard, they had less-than-extensive lifespans, and thus the diseases of old age were unknown to them. After the Department of Glory reassessed the Weepers' military role, their life expectancy went up, allowing them to live long enough to suffer the effects of <b>jalapeñosis</b>, a disease seemingly caused by a lifetime of eating the special diet of spicy Selesteine cuisine that characterizes the Grim Weepers. Weepers afflicted by early stage jalapeñosis manifest increasingly red skin and elevated body temperatures. Their breath becomes increasingly acidic, as does their body chemistry in general. As the disease progresses, the symptoms intensify, until in the late stages the patient's skin is bright red and too hot to touch and the patient's breath instantly wilts plants and inflicts chemical burns. Finally, the patient's body temperature reaches a critical point, and the patient spontaneously combusts. It is believed by historians that the historical accounts from <u>Pentex Lannogaster</u><sup>3</sup> of Selesteines "becoming as Sels" are actually ancient cases of terminal jalapeñosis being interpreted through the lens of the Selesteine myth in which the hero Sels eats a sun. Rudimentary understanding of this phenomenon must have existed before the Grim Weepers' reassignment in 971, because one of the eighth-century Hierarchs of <u>the Fractured Cities</u><sup>4</sup> invited a terminal case to a <u>bloodmoot</u><sup>5</sup> to stand next to a box of fireworks.</p></div>
<p>The exact etiology of jalapeñosis is unknown, since the Grim Weepers are reluctant to publicize their secret recipes. An exception was made for <u>Professor Hazard McKinley</u><sup>6</sup>, who spent six months doing botanical studies in Selestei before submitting a confidential report to the King. McKinley is under a non-disclosure agreement with respect to the contents of the report, though he has revealed that <u>the Mad King</u><sup>7</sup> had made some changes to the recipes that were now being reevaluated. Some biologists outside of Selestei have attempted research projects into the possible active ingredients, which have generally run aground on the utter madness that is Selesteine cuisine. Their beer is more massive by volume than concrete, and some of their condiments are also used in industrial manufacturing. It is an enduring mystery how the Selesteines are even alive, but it does give some perspective on jalapeñosis, since apparently becoming a toxic walking firebomb isn't considered a negative health outcome. It's definitely a negative janitorial outcome, because the last time a Grim Weeper was at the Disputatious Assembly, his feet burned holes in the carpet when he stood still for too long, and it was a royal pain in the ass to clean up after.</p>

Mad King Westler</p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>Joint University Strike Team for Interdisciplinary Collaboration Enforcement</h2><p>Following the invention of the <u>dark degrees</u><sup>1</sup> in the mid-ninth century, there was considerable tension between regular academia and dark academia. This was understandable, as the dark degrees were institutional brands of shame, and some universities even began exiling their dark academics to <u>the south pole</u><sup>2</sup>. Despite their professional disgrace, however, the work of dark academics was still recognized, implicitly or off the record, as containing some insights of worth, and thus a limited amount of interdisciplinary work was done between the burgeoning dark disciplines and regular academia. This work was stymied by several incidents where dark academics attempted to use the collaboration to taint the reputations of their peers.</p></div>
<p>In order to safeguard the extraction of value from the work of dark academia and protect regular academics from their erstwhile colleagues, several universities formed the Council for Interdisciplinary Collaboration in 856, which mediated interactions with dark academics in order to prevent them from taking down regular academics out of spite. This continued until 891, when the Vulterbase could not be brought to heel in the wake of the <u>Goats on Boats Affair</u><sup>3</sup>. Over the next few decades, the Council requested, and was approved for, an increasing amount of military power in order to bring the Vulterbase rebels to justice. By 931, the Council had become a globally-ranked military power and rebranded itself as the <b>Joint University Strike Team for Interdisciplinary Collaboration Enforcement</b>, aka JUSTICE. Turns out that your army has a nice tech advantage if it's literally made of the people who do military tech research.</p>
<p>In addition to power creep, the scope of the former Council's duties has also expanded beyond their original duties of keeping Pentads in line. JUSTICE also works security at research conventions, provides military defense to universities when necessary, and hunts down rogue academics who need to be eliminated. To date, very few academics have escaped their fury once roused. Sadly, as an international and interinstitutional body, they are vulnerable to bureaucracy, which is why they have yet to get permission to enter the campus of the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns to capture our own Spheven Kain. I keep giving them tips on him, but it seems he never leaves the building, so they can't grappling-hook him off the neutral ground. I'm hoping he'll slip up one of these days. If they finally get him because of me, I'll score a lot of points with them, which I need because they aren't exactly fans of my work. I guess I'm not making a lot of friends by writing papers in defense of oppressive autocrats, but what else am I supposed to use tenure for? Writing about the same "unpopular" topics everyone else is writing about to show off how progressive and daring they are? Bullshit. If tenure isn't the only thing between you and a JUSTICE tribunal, you're wasting your career.</p>

<p></p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>Joran Lake</h2><p><b>Joran Lake</b> is the only known bottomless lake. Created by the architect Hans Flugelsson on accident, it is located in the middle of <u>the Careless Continent</u><sup>1</sup> where the nation of Joran was briefly established before it was replaced by a lake. When Joran was founded, its leader, Chief Sergoblant, appointed Flugelsson as the new state's official architect. His first order was to find a way to irrigate the desert land they ruled so that they would have the supplies to raid their neighbors for better food. Flugelsson came up with many designs, but he finally settled on a national engineering project to raise the water table closer to the surface. Nobody is quite sure what process he set in motion, but in AES 845, instead of the water table rising to meet Joran, Joran sank to meet the water table and never stopped. The only reason Flugelsson is considered the first <u>imagineer</u><sup>2</sup> and not the first thanatologist is the curious Joranite custom of wearing life preservers even in the middle of a landlocked desert. Flugelsson disappears from the historic record after this.</p></div>
<p>Given that nobody really bothers to try and sort out the history of Careless, we don't know who first <u>populated Joran Lake with fish</u><sup>3</sup>. But by AES 875, adventurers who dared to explore Careless reported that Joran was well-known not only as a watering hole, but also as a source of delicious fish, and had thus become a warzone. This was to the great consternation of the Joranites, who had stayed on their "land" by building houseboats. Most of what we know about the Joran biome comes from the expedition notes of a <u>Selesteine</u><sup>4</sup> special ops team that fought its way to the lake in 912 after a rumor made it to Selestei that the fish got bigger and meaner the further down you went into the bottomless depths. These rumors were somewhat substantiated, as the Selesteine expedition reported that the hole got bigger as one went down far enough, and that the fauna were larger once the light started to fade. Sadly, further investigation of this is currently impossible, as Joran Lake became infested with <u>Ravenous Squid-Trees</u><sup>5</sup> following the completion of <u>the Yggdrasil Project</u><sup>6</sup> in 939.</p>
<p>Despite its distance, <u>Flandre</u><sup>7</sup> nevertheless has several National Response Protocol BX designations for things emerging from Joran Lake that pose an existential threat, many of which dictate similar responses as those specified, and recently demonstrated to great effect, by <u>NRP BX-392a</u><sup>8</sup>.</p>

Unfortunately for Kingslanders, the city-state is practically <i>made</i> of dark alleys. It's sometimes said that if you stretched out all of Kingsland's alleys and roads next to each other, the alleys would go further, but neither would get you far enough to escape whatever was chasing you. Because of the dangers lurking in the omnipresent alleys, Kingslanders try to stick to the city's labyrinthine public transit system, despite its sanity-defying complexity. Visitors are often surprised by such transit irregularities as subway tracks that spin the train in a barrel roll, a monorail track that loops Kingsland South but never in the same way twice, one road where the buses go off a ramp to avoid a chasm, and the strange phenomenon where the station bathroom stalls transport people to <u>the Double-North Pole</u><sup>1</sup>. Kingslanders are nothing if not resigned, however, and they bear this with faces hollow and spirits deflated.</p></div>
<p>But the transit system isn't always the safer option. The first "Killer Bus" incident occurred in AES 976. The doors on a bus in Kingsland North suddenly locked, and onlookers described the windows as being "instantly painted" with blood. In what Kingslanders call "a good day", the screaming was brief. The bus continued its route as normal, though few dared to board once they saw every surface on the inside covered in viscera. It is unknown whether the bus's driver was also killed, but a bus with no driver isn't even worth mentioning in Kingsland, so we don't know either way. Similar incidents continue to occur in Kingsland North, each time involving a slightly different method. The Killer Bus has protruded spikes, turned flat and fallen on top of passersby, transformed into a giant robot to fight another local horror, and driven straight into the river that divides the city in order to hit a passing <u>Panark diplomatic envoy</u><sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>The Killer Bus's <u>cult</u><sup>3</sup> has grown to be one of the largest in Kingsland. In 986, on the anniversary of the first Killer Bus incident, the cult began rallying to elect the Killer Bus as the sovereign of Kingsland. This movement has gained popular appeal outside of the cult, as the citizens hope that the Killer Bus will be forced to leave Kingsland in order to attend sessions of the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns. Flandre has expressed support for the movement in recognition of the Killer Bus's aid in the success of <u>NRP BX-392a</u><sup>4</sup>. This support has more than one motive, though, as electing foreign threats to the Assembly to keep tabs on them is prescribed by NRP TX-43d.</p>

The mayor of Kingsland has expressed uncertainty as to the Killer Bus's candicacy: on one hand, the Bus would take up two rows of seats, giving Kingsland unprecedented voting power in the Disputatious Assembly; on the other hand, it would mean he would have to go back to living in Kingsland.</p>

<p></p><p>I've done some reading about the Killer Bus, and it's harrowing stuff.  After the first incident, they removed it from the transit system.  The next morning, there was an extra bus at the transit station and no one could figure out which one it was.  After the next incident, they wrote down the serial number for each bus and then removed it again.  Overnight, there was a different list of serial numbers in the handwriting of the manager who had originally written it, and the bus count was up by one again.  They tried adding more measures the third time—cameras, locking the gate, caltrops on the road—but in the morning, the gate's technical log reported it was closed the whole evening, the caltrops were arranged into sanity-melting glyphs, and everyone who reviewed the camera feed instantly went mad.</p>
<p>And this time, the extra bus was parked... <i>right... in... front... of the manager's office!</i></p>
<p>Chilling stuff! I told that story to my grandchildren the other week, both because they're adorable when they're scared, and also because it's never to early to learn to fear Kingsland.</p>

<p></p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>Klaus Santanna</h2><p><b>Klaus Santanna</b> is one of the dreadful spawn of Kingsland, and one of the few phenomena of our city to turn its sights beyond the city limits. In the last century, it has risen to international attention as the sovereign of the Compass Republic, which it rules from its throne in <u>Bipolaris</u><sup>1</sup>. The true extent of Santanna's power is unknown, but it is sufficient to maintain the order of the Republic without having a legal code. It can mind control people it's touched and seems to possess some form of clairvoyance, allowing it to see anything that goes on in its realm. Despite its unnatural vigor and vitality and its ability to levitate without any visible means, Santanna rarely moves from its throne and conducts most business through proxies. It is represented in the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns by a mechanical doll, which <u>the Secretary</u><sup>2</sup> throws out every month for exceeding the permissible duration of proxy representation. Because of its reclusiveness, rumors abound as to its true, terrifying appearance. Those who know are few, and they cannot be trusted.</p></div>
<p>These days, the Compass Republic is a big name on the international stage for the global scale of its manufacturing. Soap, folding chairs, kitchenware, all sorts of miscellanea and knickknacks &mdash; you probably have some Compass goods in your house right now. The stirring sticks in the Butterfly Effect Advisory Committee's break room are Compass-produced, which is why I bring my own stick from home. Look, I know we Kingslanders are a sorry lot when it comes to avoiding terrible things, even though most of the time there's no choice we can make that doesn't end up terribly. But my grandparents say that we breathed a godsdamned sigh of relief when Klaus Santanna left town. Its <u>cult</u><sup>3</sup> even thought the <u>Tesseraction</u><sup>4</sup> was upon us, grabbed their weapons, and marched into a dark alleyway, which really tied up a lot of loose ends. 'course, then we started hearing things about what Santanna was up to in the Compass Republic, and then it became the bloody sovereign. At least it's menacing far away from us, so we can focus on all the menacing things closer to home.</p>
<p>Still, there's one Kingslander who isn't happy with Santanna being only that far away. I wish <u>Jango Gunnerson</u><sup>5</sup> all the best in his quest to find the <u>Ultimate Dragonopolis</u><sup>6</sup>, which is probably one of the only things that could stop Santanna if it began taking a more active interest in global politics.</p>

In a conceit common to that time, it was published under an editor's note claiming the text to be much older and recently uncovered by its author, who remains anonymous.

<hr><span class="signature"><p></p></span>
<p><i>A <u>Selesteine</u><sup>3</sup>, an <u>Ulgravian</u><sup>4</sup>, and a Flandrean walked into an open clearing. "Come, let us show which of us is the mightier people," suggested the Selesteine. "We shall each plant a tree and lash our banner to it. The one whose banner is nearest to the heavens shall be called the mightiest, for the mightiest reach to the heavens to grasp the stars in their fingers."</i></p>
<p><i>"Surely not," said the Ulgravian. "Let us each plant a tree, and the one whose banner casts the furthest shadow shall be called the mightiest, for might is not to be found in mere ascension but in ranging across the surface of the world."</i></p>
<p><i>"I shall agree to either challenge," said the Flandrean, "as long as the rules disqualify those whose trees are eliminated. But I should point out that both challenges are mathematically equivalent." So each planted a tree and tied a colored flag to the top to distinguish them.</i></p>
<p><i>When the trees had grown, the three botanists reconvened in the clearing. The tree to the east, unnaturally thick, had fallen over under its own weight. The tree to the west, thin and sickly, looked as if it were about to fall over. Yet the tree to the north was healthy and strong, and it stood above the others. Because it was noon and the sun was bright, each squinted to see the banners flying high atop the trees.</i></p>
<p><i>"I see my banner atop the northern tree," claimed the Selesteine. "The Ulgravian tree has no roots, and it has withered. The Flandrean tree has grown thick with schemes, and it has collapsed under the weight of them. The Selesteine tree stands tall and unbowed."</i></p>
<p><i>"You have stared too long into the sun, you madman. It is mine atop the northern tree," claimed the Ulgravian. "The Flandrean tree is the one withered and sickly, for it was too cautious of the ground to lay roots. The Selesteine tree has grown too thick, for it thought that was strength. The Ulgravian banner blows high and free."</i></p>
<p><i>"You are both fools," concluded the Flandrean. "The Selesteine has identified the Ulgravian tree, and the Ulgravian has identified the Selesteine tree. But lo, the northern tree is the Flandrean tree. I have carved the proof into its trunk every year, so that none could question. Approach it and behold." And so the Selesteine and the Ulgravian approached the northern tree, tripped the tripwire attached to the western tree, and were crushed as it fell over on them.</i></p>

The Ulgravian Diaspora</p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>Lepazzia</h2><p>There are so many wonderful places in this world, and I rejoice that this report gives us cause to speak of many of them.  In this section we will focus on the nation of <b>Lepazzia</b>, which is as beautiful as it is misunderstood by outsiders.</p></div>
<p>Most known to foreigners is the Lepazzian custom of being agreeable past the point of sanity.  But this is an incomplete simplification.  It is true that in Lepazzian culture, disagreement is unconscionable and violence is beyond barbaric.  But  when we caricature Lepazzians as being wholy unaggressive, we overlook their long and vicious history of <i>passive</i>-aggression.  Within a family, for example, children might negotiate their sibling rivalries through indirect means, breaking each other's possessions or manipulating their parents into favoring one or the other child.  At the national level, the techniques employed can be truly harrowing.  One recalls the tension of the Eight Days' War, in which five nations simultaneously declared war on Lepazzia before withdrawing it eight days later upon finding <u>flowers in the bedrooms of every major government official</u><sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>In the Assembly, Lepazzia has an international reputation for always voting in favor, regardless of the bill or motion put to the floor.  This, too, is an artifact of Lepazzian culture which is often misunderstood.  The Lepazzian Senate votes unanimously in favor of whatever is put to the Senate floor.  However, before any motion is put forward, there are days of politicking and maneuvering to determine what should happen.  Lepazzian Senators find themselves confronted with aggrieved notes on their seats, unpleasant rumors, and personal attacks in the newspapers.  You will find no one so hardened against human pettiness than a Lepazzian politician, and yet a few reliably commit suicide every year.  In any case the Sovereign of Lepazzia does little with his votes—and, it must be said, looks vaguely horrified every time someone votes against a measure—but you can be sure that behind the scenes, he has brutally crushed the self esteem of multiple Sovereigns.  I myself once heard the Sovereign of <u>Incendia</u><sup>2</sup> break down in tears after a particularly belittling conference, although to be fair he does that all the time, the poor dear.</p>
<p>With regard to the Disarrangement Act, I heartily encourage the Assembly to consider that Lepazzia's new neighbors will be subject to unimaginable psychological torment, and that we could see the emergence of trauma at a cultural level.  This will make selecting suitably hardy countries difficult.  It is not accidental, remember, that <u>Ulgrav</u><sup>3</sup> disposed of all of its land after a mere three hundred years on the Lepazzian border.</p>

The Ulgravian Diaspora</p><p>Lepazzia keeps something of a low profile in the international community, but it's important to remember their ostensible neutrality doesn't translate to a neutral impact on global politics.  For example, if the Lepazzian Sovereign had truly wanted to agree with the other Sovereigns, he would have also abstained on the <u>I'll Legislate It Act</u><sup>1</sup> instead of voting in favor.  And the <u>Massively Parallel Peace Conference</u><sup>2</sup> illustrates, perhaps a little more clearly, that Lepazzia has it out for all of us.  It might be wise to look past the cultural differences between us and realize that they probably consider themselves, in their own way, to be at war with everyone else.</p>

When their cultural passive-aggression had reached new heights in the fourth century, they literally drew a line in the sand and dug a massive trench around their entire country to make a point to their neighbors on <u>the Careless Continent</u><sup>1</sup>. While most geologists are confused as to how merely digging a trench could result, as it did, in Lepazzia drifting off into the ocean, in my opinion as a sociophysicist, this is no mystery at all. Lepazzian culture is nothing if not one that keeps others at arms' length. The Lepazzian Split was simply the physical manifestation of the social phenomenon in accordance with the principles of sociophysics.</p>

The participants for the experiments, run by the <u>National Academy of Velskyavo</u><sup>3</sup>, were chosen by a single-elimination endurance tournament in which bands were required to play music while undergoing astronaut training. The Lunchtime Fallacy narrowly defeated their opponents in the finals, the neometal classical band Sneezing on the King Eternal, when Sneezing's drummer fell unconscious in the third hour inside the multiaxis g-force machine and lost his grip on his drumsticks, which flew out at high speed and knocked out their bassist. In the maiden voyage of the warp-equipped shuttle &mdash; christened as the <i>Rainbow's Teeth</i> by Lunchtime's lead singer, Groz Hoffman &mdash; The Lunchtime Fallacy entered warp with a performance of their hit single "Hit Me With a Truck" and exited five minutes later on the other side of the world in <u>Lepazzia</u><sup>4</sup>, where they played a few numbers for a surprised crowd before warping back to Katskria with an encore of "Ain't No Whale".</p></div>
<p>The Lunchtime Fallacy rode on this fame for a few years, until they were inadvertently banned by the <u>Don't Think I Won't Act</u><sup>5</sup>. Now international criminals guilty only of the crime of having a pretty sweet band name, they broke into the National Academy's warp research wing and stole the <i>Rainbow's Teeth</i>, making their getaway with the debut performance of "But You'll Never Take Our Trousers". Through the careful manipulation of time signatures, Lunchtime was able to introduce time dilation into their warp travel, spending only a day inside the warp before materializing in the capital of <u>Shaster</u><sup>6</sup> three months later. Thereafter, Lunchtime became temporal vagrants, appearing out of the warp on the crest of a song and playing a gig long enough for their agent to grab more food from the nearest market before disappearing back into the ether. Because they spend more time in warp than with the rest of us, the members of Lunchtime appear to have only aged a few years since they began their journey through space and time thirty years ago.</p>
<p>Before their exodus, The Lunchtime Fallacy's lyrics focused on themes of the difficulty of engaging in politics in an increasingly globalized world and the marginalization of smaller communities. Their later, post-Act work has abandoned this to become more abstract and disconnected, a trend that National Academy researchers are worried represents long-term detrimental effects from extended warp exposure.</p>

So it was for <b>King Westler of Selestei</b>, a kind and gentle soul who unfortunately became the heir to the <u>Selesteine</u><sup>1</sup> throne. He spent his childhood appreciating nature instead of fighting it and wrote poetry about the loveliness of things instead of their weak points and arm strength. This made him something of a pariah, but the royal family made no attempts to remove him from the succession, hoping that the mantle of kingship would shape him into a proper Selesteine. Fatefully, when he eventually was coronated in 817, this did not occur.</p></div>
<p>King Westler's foreign policy was uncharacteristically timid for a Selesteine monarch. When his mother, Queen Titania the Immovable, had ruled, she had sponsored Disputatious Assembly dinner parties for the express purpose of drinking the other sovereigns under the table and laughing at them. Westler, on the other hand, shrunk from public appearances and the pressure of international politics. Because of this, Selesteine psychologists began to murmur among themselves that he was off his rocker, unthinkable as it was to the Selesteines that their king should be such a wimp. This made him a prime target for the <u>Lepazzian</u><sup>2</sup> sovereign, who had flowers delivered to him weekly by <u>the Esoteric Order of Florists</u><sup>3</sup> in progressively more unnerving places. When the nerve-wracked king woke up one morning coughing up petals, he finally snapped and went completely off the deep end.</p>
<p>In 830, the final year of his reign, the Mad King was well and truly mad. He launched into a flurry of activity, outlawing and legalizing things at random until he had created a legislative mess unequaled until the <u>Don't Think I Won't Act</u><sup>4</sup> over a century later. He declared war and made peace weekly, all while breaking and renegotiating nonsensical treaties, often with countries he was at war with, and occasionally declaring war <i>in</i> the treaty. He hired a team of <u>Flandrean</u><sup>5</sup> propagandists to obfuscate anything and everything he was doing, then hired a team of Lepazzian propagandists to confound the Flandrean propaganda. The Mad King's reign finally ended when he kidnapped several <u>Shastrian</u><sup>6</sup> machinists and forced them to build him a giant robotic exoskeleton. When it was completed, he declared war on the ocean, boarded the exoskeleton, and jumped into the depths. After this, the Selesteines took a day off to have a drink and recover from the year, then rolled their law and foreign policy back to Queen Titania's.</p>

Shaster</p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>Mad legal practice</h2><p>As my esteemed colleague Dr. Christophy would no doubt identify, there are overwhelming parallels between the development of the field of physics and that of more social-facing fields, such as law.  Before the days of the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns, civilization's best shot at physics was knowing that rocks fall back down after you catapult them.  Likewise, "law" was doing whatever the king said.</p></div>
<p>We can follow this trend up to the present day: as civilization developed, the haphazard, <i>ad hoc</i> systems of ancient history were replaced with one regulated by rules and independently verifiable procedure.  This paradigm defined the core of legal practice as we know it today.</p>
<p>However, physics encountered a conceptual revolution with the development of quantum mechanics and the grudging acceptance that the old rules might not apply consistently.  So, too, has the practice of law undergone a conceptual revolution—one resulting in the field of practice colloquially known as <b>mad law</b>.</p>
<p>The original mad lawyer is widely considered to be Kelsi Hanover, whose <u>Shastrian</u><sup>1</sup> legal practice had fallen on a run of difficult cases at the time.  The final straw was a 894 case in which she had to defend a client who had committed a crime while remote-controlled by future Sovereign <u>Klaus Santanna</u><sup>2</sup>.  This matter dragged the trial into convoluted matters of international law and extradition, further worsened by the fact that the crime was not illegal in the <u>Compass Republic</u><sup>3</sup>, where Santanna had been at the time of the event.  Hanover motioned for a fifteen-day "epiphany recess," which is a common Shastrian practice in cases where one or more participants in a trial receive sudden, urgent inspiration for a brilliant idea.  At the end of the recess, Hanover returned with a modal legal framework that applied sections of various laws conditionally and/or hypothetically, allowing the trial to proceed across multiple counterfactuals simultaneously.</p>
<p>(The judge is said to have commented "This is the maddest thing I've ever seen" before acquitting her defendant, thus explaining the name, but that statement is widely considered by scholars to be apocryphal.)</p>
<p>The fundamental insight behind mad law is an essentially memetosociological one—laws do not merely exist and thereby shape society; they must also be enforced and applied to any given circumstance.  Consequently, it is necessary to select <i>which</i> laws must apply if you wish them applied; conversely, if you wish no laws applied, all you have to do is fail to apply them.  In his journals, <u>St. Stafford</u><sup>4</sup> wrote that such thinking to him was indispensable in forming his early approach to problems like his adaptation of the rules of <u>horseball</u><sup>5</sup> or the construction of the <u>Zeitgeist Manipulator</u><sup>6</sup>.</p>
<p>The practice of mad law has seen greater acceptance in the modern day, but it faces opposition from more traditional lawyers, as well as the <u>Hegemony of Whales</u><sup>7</sup>, which maintains the whole endeavor is a <u>Flandrean</u><sup>8</sup> plot.</p>

Flandre</p><p>A connection I would emphasize between the development of quantum mechanics and the invention of mad law is that mad law <i>predates</i> quantum theory. As a sociophysicist, I can't help but see a causal connection here. Would it be so far beyond the pale to suggest that quantum mechanics was not developed before mad law because quantum systems did not <i>exist</i> before mad law? Would it be that crazy to suggest that the indeterminacy of the laws of humanity is what gave rise to the indeterminacy of the laws of nature?</p>
<p>Dr. Rubric is telling me that it would be, and she's brandishing her mug rather menacingly, so I must conclude that this requires more thought at another time.</p>

<p></p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>Marionette children</h2><p>The fisher crow (<i>Corvus bastardus</i>), also known as the bastard crow, the marionette crow, or metonymically as a marionette child, is a curious scavenger corvid native to the <u>Razor Valley</u><sup>1</sup> region of <u>Shaster</u><sup>2</sup> and <u>Selestei</u><sup>3</sup>. Fisher crows are distinguished by their long and lean bodies, but most especially by the extremely thin, prehensile tendrils that trail from their claws. These tendrils are capable of cutting through flesh with ease. Unexpectedly for something that isn't from Barcu, however, fisher crows usually refrain from using their tendrils to hunt prey directly, and instead prefer the much more horrifying method of using them to control child-size marionette puppets. The popular sobriquet "<b>marionette children</b>" was first used to refer to these puppets, but these days it is often used to refer to the fisher crows themselves.</p></div>
<p>Fisher crows are omnivorous, eating fruits, nuts, insects, other birds, and carrion. They will not hesitate to prey on live animals, even larger livestock or the occasional human. When they attack live prey much larger than themselves, they approach from above, seize it with their marionette, and then carry it off into the sky. Some research was once attempted into how it is that fisher crows can lift large prey when they appear to have no more lifting power than other birds, but this was done by having volunteers bait fisher crows into carrying them off, which resulted in a cancelled research program and a complimentary <u>thanatology degree</u><sup>4</sup>. It is no longer considered an open research question.</p>
<p>An international incident was precipitated in AES 967 when it was discovered that <u>The Contagious Republic of Paul Vigotski</u><sup>5</sup> had colonized a fisher crow. The Assembly immediately began disputing whether the more pressing issue was that the Republic has developed the capability to infect across species or that it had now had the use of a marionette child. In the confusion, Vigotski himself slipped away, prompting the Assembly to order the <u>Taurus Research Station</u><sup>6</sup> to be turned planetside for the first time, ostensibly for observation. Vigotski was caught in the parking lot and returned to the Assembly, where the assembled sovereigns ordered the Republic to turn over the infected bird for termination. The Republic, rather <i>too</i> easily, complied. Since the crow was technically a citizen of the Contagious Republic, the extradition paperwork took a week to get straight, at which point it was summarily executed and the corpse burned. Ever since then, there seem to be an awful lot of crows in the trees around the Assembly building.</p>

<p>So, 940 was when all this shit started going downhill.  <u>Selestei</u><sup>1</sup> and the <u>germs</u><sup>2</sup> were at war, <u>Flandre</u><sup>3</sup> and the <u>whales</u><sup>4</sup> were at it, half the <u>Careless Continent</u><sup>5</sup> was at war with other countries and the other half were at war with themselves—basically it was the most war we've had since the <u>War of Durun's Ass</u><sup>6</sup>, except this time the little twerps couldn't even muster the self-awareness to form teams first.</p>
<p>So along comes fucking <u>Lepazzia</u><sup>7</sup> and tells everyone they're showing up to a peace conference.  And of course everyone comes, because Lepazzia doesn't really throw its weight around but holy shit do you not want to get on their bad side.  So everyone shows up and the Lepazzian Sovereign Assface Bumblefuck—okay, not actually his name, but it might as well be—Bumblefuck gives this speech about everyone's going to make nice so they can feel good.  And this lot is all politicians, they might have developmentally disabled squirrels for brains but they can read between the lines when someone's threatening them, so they all hurry into their assigned rooms and sign the quickest, dirtiest treaties they can.</p>
<p>So, like, think about that.  Peace treaties are supposed to shape the conduct of the nations involved, right?  And if two nations are <i>at war</i>, then those nations probably have some fucking issues, right?  After all, only an inbred cretin would think that nations go to war for <i>no fucking reason,</i> right?  So given all that, if the original issues still exist, and you still make those nations sign a <i>shitty peace treaty</i>, then <i>what the fuck do you think happens next?</i></p>
<p>I fucking swear, you can trace every political catastrophe in the last fifty years to this disaster of a conference.  The first problem, obviously, is that this is peak Lepazzia here.  Like, passive-aggressively threatening people with passive-aggression to force them to self-sabotage?  I don't know why we didn't bomb the fuckers into radioactive shrapnel three centuries ago.  Fucking cowardly Sovereign.  </p>
<p>Anyways, second problem once the first half of the Careless Continent stopped fighting each other, they all had civil wars, and once the other half finished their civil wars they started fighting each other.  Flandre and the Hegemony are in cold war still, and that's basically the main reason we have to deal with this Disarrangement Act bullshit in the first place.  The <i>only</i> decent peace that came out of this is that Selestei and the Contagious Republic aren't at war, and <i>that wasn't even a proper war in the first place!</i>  Like, fuck, it was some twit sneezing on doorknobs because he refused to take his medicine!  How is that a war, you fuckers?  Get over here, I'll show you you some fucking war.</p>

 How were the Great Genitalia of Hazam constructed, and who would order such a thing built?  Is the <u>Chorus Perpetual</u><sup>1</sup> truly keeping the planet in its orbit if the planet existed before the whales did?</p></div>
<p>One such mystery is a deceptively simple question: why are there fish?  Or more precisely, why are there <i>such</i> fish, rather than others that could have been?  One is tempted to approach the problem abstractly, or even as a metaphor for life, but the researchers of <b>metafishics</b> would reject that approach.  Indeed, there seem to be many interesting <i>fish-specific</i> avenues of exploration to be found here.</p>
<p>Consider the case of <u>Joran Lake</u><sup>2</sup>.  150 years ago it was a desert; then it became a lake, and then twenty years later it was suddenly full of fish.  Another twenty-five after that and we have reports of <u>Selesteine</u><sup>3</sup> braves fighting sea monsters in its deeps.  Perhaps the expanding lake encountered some subterranean cavern, but metafishicians have performed experiments with goldfish and believe some kind of fish-specific generative principle is at work.  </p>
<p>The most well-known of these experiments is likely the Generational Aquadome, run by the <u>Contagious Republic of Paul Vigotski</u><sup>4</sup>.  It is a massive, artificial aquatic environment divided into two sections.  Both sections received a healthy population of goldfish in AES 940, then one section was hidden from human observation.  Metafishicians watched the visible goldfish population remain more or less the same until they switched which section was visible in AES 965.  Doing so revealed a chthonic nightmare of horrific tentacled predation.  This new population was studied for another 25 years—during which time several adjunct professors lost their lives when they got too close—until the other section was revealed also to have monstrously evolved.</p>
<p>The results of this and other experiments are summarized in <i>Grantham's Law</i>, which states that aquatic evolution proceeds with increasing speed and frightfulness proportional to time spent without human observation.  Given the specificity of the affected population (e.g. the prairie dogs of Nosser had hundreds of years to evolve away from humans but did not become monsters and wipe out the <u>Careless Continent</u><sup>5</sup>) and the observation-dependent nature of its rules, many metafishicians suspect that <u>Barcu</u><sup>6</sup> is somehow to blame.  Others point to <u>Razor Valley</u><sup>7</sup> as a possible terrestrial example of Grantham's Law.  In any case, nearly all metafishicians are in agreement that a lack of "attention pollution" in the oceans will lead to the evolution of some hideous apocalyptic monster that will kill us all—which makes the stretches of ocean rendered impassable by <u>Ravenous Squid-Trees</u><sup>8</sup> problematic.  I urge your consciousness of this in considering the Disarrangement Act.</p>
<p>Finally, some metafishicians suspect the existence of the <u>Hegemony of Whales</u><sup>9</sup> may have something to do with Grantham's Law.  It must be said, however, that they are all Flandreans, and their arguments rely on speciesist assumptions that intelligent whales are a horrifying thing.</p>

Ever since its disappearance &mdash; or rather, <i>appearance</i>, in a sense &mdash; in the year AES 25, it has defied any and all explanation as to why all of the ocean off the coast of Kingsland is just <i>not there</i>. For most scholars, after nearly a millennium of study, the consensus is that it has something to do with <u>antiweather</u><sup>2</sup> and that prying further is asking for trouble. Trying to investigate too deeply into anything in the vicinity of Kingsland is usually a fast-track ticket to being spoken of in the past tense, and the usual madness of Barcu extends into the Missing Sea as well.</p></div>
<p>This, of course, is no obstacle to the crackpots and <u>pentads</u><sup>3</sup> on the fringes of the academy. The prominent imagineer, Vexis Harsir, has made a great deal of the <u>fixed-point cube</u><sup>4</sup> that has been slowly scarring a line across the ocean floor of the Missing Sea. This, in turn, has been vehemently opposed by the dysthetician Johannes Chezmen, whose pet theory explains both the Missing Sea and <u>qualified spontaneous evaporation</u><sup>5</sup> in terms of partial differential equations that define planar slices through the possibility space of <u>divine assemblies</u><sup>6</sup>.</p>
<p>The exact reasoning involved in this debate is worthy of the attention of the regular academy. On Harsir's account, the cubes are not <i>descriptive</i> fixed points, but rather <i>prescriptive</i> fixed points. The Missing Sea, then, exists because the cube has an "internal land-sea configuration pattern" that does not match the elevation of the Iurezzan tectonic place, leading to the cube defining a land boundary below sea level. Chezmen's theory, which would take an article unto itself to explain, seeks to one-up Harsir's theory by making the cubes <i>explananda</i> rather than the <i>explanans</i> of the Missing Sea. Fixed-point cubes are too geometrical, he argues, to account for the <i>organic</i> shape of the edge of the Sea where the water abruptly stops. Moreover, the Missing Sea cannot simply be a division between land and water mediated by a continental land-sea regulator, because aquatic animals, despite the complete absence of water, are still able to swim through the Missing Sea. This phenomenon, Chezmen insists, can only be due to divine intervention; hence the differential equations. The literature on both sides is quite deep, and a review of it may break some new ground on the topic in the regular academy.</p>
<p>Neither Harsir nor Chezmen, for some reason, make any reference to <u>Zor Olo</u><sup>7</sup> in their theories, which is a major weakness given the moon's place in the genesis of the Missing Sea. Chezmen makes an offhand reference to divine assemblies targeted at heavenly bodies during a discussion  of <u>Selesteine</u><sup>8</sup> mythology, which some of his peers have taken to imply that the divine assemblies picked out by the equations of the Missing Sea are those targeted to Zor Olo. Chezmen has yet to respond to this through anything other than interpretive dance.</p>

It makes me wonder how those reactions compare to those of the victims of the <b>National Academy of <u>Velskyavo</u><sup>1</sup></b>, where a failing grade is literally a death sentence.</p></div>
<p>The scholars of the National Academy of Velskayavo are, I confess, a rather ruthless breed.  Their all-encompassing educational system (more on that in a moment) allows only the top thirty percent of a class to matriculate, while the bottom twenty percent are demoted.  Not all of those demoted will actually make it to the lower class, of course, as many of them will be executed.  Such high stakes on their academic outcomes mean that competition among students can become literally cutthroat at times.  I have occasionally found it necessary at international research conferences to gently remind visiting Velskyavan professors that they are not permitted to assassinate fellow conference-goers to claim their presentation slots.  As you can imagine, given such a culture, it is no surprise that the National Academy of Velskyavo boasts the second-highest proportion of <u>Pentad academics</u><sup>2</sup> in the world—the highest, of course, being the <u>Stratsky Foundation for Economics and Insurrection</u><sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p>The Academy's culture has greatly influenced the larger culture of Velskyavo, due in large part to their sinister, scheming Department of Education suborning every other branch of government decades ago.  As the years passed, the Education Secretary (who is also Sovereign of Velskyavo) began working academic structures into every facet of society, to the point where every citizen on record has some form of <u>research-related trauma</u><sup>4</sup> and studying consumes 800 billion of the nation's man-hours each year.  The unification of the Education Department and the Justice Department allows courts to assign grades instead of sentences, with the worst grades being reserved to knock criminals out of their current class status.</p>
<p>Though the costs might be high, the effects have been impressive.  Decades of selection pressures have raised the country's education attainment above that of any other country in <i>history</i>, to say nothing of the achievements of their graduates.  There is some controversy over whether to include <u>Marvin Fitch</u><sup>5</sup> among this number, as on the one hand, they awarded him degrees in both Thanatology and Imagineering, but on the other hand, so did everyone else.  The Academy also likely has failed to publish numerous groundbreaking studies of <u>🔇</u><sup>6</sup>, judging by the way tuition seems to keep increasing but no one can say where the money is going.</p>

In AES 946, the Theocracy of Rime's High Priest suddenly decided that because of stupid reasons their stupid little god suddenly had a problem with Ulgravian airships beautifying their stupid little skies.  By AES 947, Mr. Suicidal down there declares holy war.  So we taught the little punk a lesson.</p></div>
<p>The Night of Storms was a long time coming, for shitty reasons.  Shit is something no one really thinks about when they think about airships.  The custom, of course, had long been to dump it while flying over <u>Lepazzia</u><sup>2</sup>, but somewhere around the early 900's they invented guns big enough to reach zeppelin cruising altitude and started dropping hints every time we dropped shit.  So next we started dumping it in the ocean, but within a couple years the Cetacean Wars came to an end and dropping shit on <u>Hegemony</u><sup>3</sup> territory was against the peace terms.  So we were collectively like "fuck it, we'll drop it on Kingsland, it's not like they're not already neck-deep in shit."</p>
<p>Turns out Kingsland didn't work either, since zeppelins rely on the laws of physics to stay floating, and Barcu is <u>kind of a lawless place</u><sup>4</sup>.  So the first ships that went there ended up turning around and just dumping their shit east of Barcu where the Hantu used to live.</p>
<p>'Course, if we'd bothered to check the map, we'd have realized the Theocracy of Rime had sprung up there recently.  Nowadays we sell our shit to <u>Shaster</u><sup>5</sup> because they've got some device designed by the unquestionable <u>Dr. Stafford</u><sup>6</sup>, so really they should have thanked us for the gift.  But instead the little shit went and had a "new and holy vision from Whats-his-face" and declared that we were enemies of the faith or whatever.  Sovereign Jhatu didn't give a fuck, so he just ordered the whole fleet to cover the High Priest's palace in shit.  That should have put him in his place, but he went and declared a holy war like the little twerp he was.</p>
<p>Ulgrav doesn't back down, you hear me?  When we were horse-bound hordes we fucking ruled the plains, and the thunder of hooves was the only warning you got that we were about to fuck up your little prairie town.  But today?  Oh, you should have seen it.  My buddy <u>Yasser</u><sup>7</sup> was just a little boy at the time, but he tells me the sound of a thousand propellers sounded like dubstep on God's jukebox.  Rime didn't stand a chance.  They didn't even have high-altitude artillery.  We bombed the fuckers so far down into the earth that we dug up the <u>ominous fixed-point cube</u><sup>8</sup> the High Priest's palace had been using as a foundation.  The light and the noise were so intense <u>Flandre</u><sup>9</sup> thought a fucking volcano was erupting and Kingsland thought it was Tuesday.  We bombed them so hard the fucking weather was <i>permanently altered</i>.</p>
<p>Anyways, to make a long story short, no one's declared war on us since then.</p>

Its hulking, industrial carapace takes up a full half of the Butterfly Effect Advisory Committee's break room. On Tuesdays, it emits a constant hum that resonates with all of the silverware, making the conference room next to the break room impossible to do any work in on account of the clattering. The user interface is badly designed, and half of the buttons "accidentally" trip safety overrides, making the machine capable of causing serious injury to its operator. A non-negligible percent of the time, it turns the cup into coffee instead of filling it. There's no place to remove the used coffee grounds, but it never runs out of room no matter how much more we keep adding, and some of the Committee members are starting to worry about where it's all going. And yet, it makes the best damn coffee you ever tasted. It's infuriating.</p></div>
<p>Say what you will about the <u>alleged professor</u><sup>1</sup>, and I certainly do, but he was one clever sonnuvabitch. The OPCS is a technological marvel capable of dispensing coffee to any point within a hundred feet through what IT tells us is a wormhole similar to the one created by a <u>Grimer Primer</u><sup>2</sup>. Having warp technology in the break room has been deemed a major workplace safety violation, but none of the office supervisors have been able to get its removal approved, because it's on record as being the property of <u>Placeholden</u><sup>3</sup>, and moving it would require getting the sovereign thereof to sign off on the move. Not that getting the signature would help; the uninstall manual has <u>🔇</u><sup>4</sup> in it.</p>
<p>The Secretor makes some non-coffee beverages, too, but its performance is less consistent doing them. When I figured out where the cream soda menu was, instead of filling the cup I had put into the cup receptacle, it filled all of the cups in the cupboards, then added cream to Gwen's coffee in the next room. While it is technically capable of making hot chocolate, it seems to only recognize toilet bowls as valid containers for it. <u>The Secretary</u><sup>5</sup> loves hot chocolate, so eventually she just started bringing a toilet-shaped novelty mug when she comes by for meetings. Some of the dysfunctions are fairly useful for other purposes, as well: the steamed milk options actually launch seek-and-destroy missiles, which came in handy the one time Cincinatta let a <u>marionette child</u><sup>6</sup> into the Committee wing of the building.</p>

<p></p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>Ominous fixed-point cubes</h2><p>The <b>ominous fixed-point cubes</b> are strange, cubical, black solids located at precise coordinates with respect to the center of the planet. They are utterly immovable, hovering in the air whenever the land falls out from under them. They rotate with the planet, though over the centuries they have been found <i>not</i> to track the tectonic plates, resulting in an apparent movement of the cubes at the rate of continental drift. This occasionally causes trouble for long-term human structures near a fixed-point cube. The historic cathedral in the <u>Shastrian</u><sup>1</sup> mountain town of Coilon has to be moved before the end of the century, as it was built underneath a massive cube that has been slowly descending to ground level as plate buckling raises the town's elevation. Similarly, the city of San-Seintil in <u>Ouril</u><sup>2</sup> was abandoned in the eighth century when a cube surfaced through the foundation of the nearby dam, flooding it. Seemingly innocuous cubes can pose trouble, too. While the larger ones are easily visible, smaller ones at higher altitudes have been known to take out inattentive airplanes, and the <u>Taurus Research Station</u><sup>3</sup> has had several narrow misses with featureless black cubes nearly tearing holes straight through the station.</p></div>
<p>Nobody knows where the cubes come from. Some are sheer and blank, while others have minute geometrical patterns inscribed on their faces. Until around a century ago, despite the ramblings of penny dreadfuls, it was thought that the cubes just <i>were</i>, and had no more purpose to them than any other feature of the landscape. This assumption was challenged by the illustrious <u>Dr. Stafford</u><sup>4</sup>, who scribed a formula that could be solved for the locations of every fixed-point cube on the planet. As usual, nobody really knows what the formula means or how he came up with it, but it is accurate for all known cubes and has successfully predicted the locations of cubes then undiscovered. Stafford's brilliant formula put to rest one centuries-old fear: that there might be a large fixed-point cube in <u>Zor Olo's</u><sup>5</sup> orbit, and that when Zor Olo crashes into it, whatever is inside of it will be freed. It did this at the cost of replacing it with a new fear, that of a predicted cube larger than the planet itself and a vast astronomical distance. I'm told it already has a <u>cult in Kingsland</u><sup>6</sup>.</p>
<p>The cubes' complete and total immovability has made them a metaphor throughout the ages for those facets of life which must be accepted as they are and cannot be changed. Ever since civilization figured out that continental drift makes them "move" slowly across the surface, they've also become harbingers of the inevitable. This makes it easy to, say, put a fake cube on the good couch in the Butterfly Effect Advisory Committee break room to keep certain unnamed individuals from sleeping on it.</p>

Pantheons of Kingsland</p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>The Panark Fleet</h2><p><b>The Panark Fleet</b> is a vagrant nation originating from a loose coalition of stateless buccaneers. As the military technology of the major oceanic powers increased, the proto-Panarkians shifted from raiding merchants to acting as independent shipping contractors. After the tense Banana Incident, in which Panark nearly came to war with <u>Lepazzia</u><sup>1</sup>, the Panark Fleet declared itself as a sovereign state and sought membership in the Disputatious Assembly. This was initially rejected on the grounds that Panark did not control any land, which prompted Panark to spend the next few years covertly stealing sand, topsoil, and gravel from other countries until they had turned their major carriers each into their own biome. This provoked intense debate in the Assembly as to what kind of land a country needed to control to be recognized. The matter was eventually settled in Panark's favor by pressure from <u>Ulgrav</u><sup>2</sup>, which had begun selling off all of its land and wanted some precedent set to keep its own Assembly seat.</p></div>
<p>Since the advent of computing technology, Panark has become the world's largest provider of computer cycles. Most large-scale computing is done in massive server clusters stored in the depths of Panarkian carriers, which use the ocean as an unlimited heatsink. This has drawn the ire of the Hegemony of Whales for its effect on ocean currents, resulting in a status quo where the Panark Fleet is constantly on the move to avoid the Hegemony's military. The Fleet took this as a provocation to stop paying their Whale Tariffs, which has only worsened relations. Unlike <u>Flandrean</u><sup>3</sup> oil ships, Panarkian cruisers are rarely contracted as tariff-free transport because they cannot move in predictable routes without the Hegemony catching them.</p>
<p>Because of their substantial available computational substrate, the Panark Fleet has the greatest number of <u>computational theologians</u><sup>4</sup> per capita, and most of the non-carrier ships are run essentially as techno-monasteries. The technomonks of Panark are widely regarded for their charitable acts and unmercenary IT work. Their critical role in engineering the systems that allow the Hegemon of Whales to attend the Disputatious Assembly in the flesh is responsible for keeping the stormy relations between the two from breaking into open war.</p>
<p>The Fleet is generally opposed to the Disarrangement Act on the grounds that having to take on more land would overburden their ships. Most suspect that a more pressing concern is that carrying out the Act will raise uncomfortable questions as to how and whence Panark obtained the land they currently have.</p>

When every space-capable country and Kingsland attached their own thrusters to the station, there was no rhyme or reason to where the thrusters were placed. Now turning the Taurus in any direction requires calculations too complicated for anybody but the Fleet to compute, by virtue of their unmatched computational resources. Nominally, the Fleet does the math for the Assembly as a due, but whenever other sovereigns make fun of Panark for having "fake land", they always change the topic to the Taurus, and eventually the others caught their drift.</p>

When it comes to Kingslanders, however, that rule doesn't hold true, mostly because their legends have an unfortunate tendency to slither through the walls at irregular intervals and eat them.  This makes them an interesting edge case for memetosociologists, who use the religious constructs of Kingsland as sort of a control group with which to evaluate the beliefs of other cultures.</p></div>
<p>It is unclear to what extent Kingslander religious beliefs affect the larger questions about whether a god or gods exist, for it is a matter of documented record that Kingsland is home to many paranatural entities not found anywhere else in the world, and the alleged deities worshipped by the Kingslanders might just be bigger fish in the same pond—a sort of supernatural protection racket, if you will.  Certainly some of the cultic deities—<u>Buddy "Literally Made of Snakes" Johnson</u><sup>1</sup>, for example—seem to fit this theory.  But for others, such as Silentus or the Conjoined Abominations, it's ambiguous whether there is some external power that explains the <u>phenomena</u><sup>2</sup> associated with it, or whether these are just ad hoc explanations of naturally-occurring events.</p>
<p>The cults of Kingsland inhabit an ever-shifting political landscape, both because of constant intrigue between different cults, and because parts of Kingsland sometimes move around for no discernible reason.  It is said that the cults can't offer an embrace of friendship without plunging a sacrificial dagger into your back (compare to the similar proverb about the <u>Fractured Cities</u><sup>3</sup>, which holds that every Hierarch's handshake is laced with contact poison).  A given cult might not recognize another cult's deity as legitimate for political reasons.  This means Kingsland properly has <i>multiple</i> pantheons, each comprising the deities of a group of allied cults.</p>
<p>Cultic worship in Kingsland is heavily based on sacrifice and exhortations to the deity to please, please stay the hell away.  Some cults, like the Order of the Ebon Serpent, find their rituals entirely ineffective, often resulting in <u>spillover into other countries</u><sup>4</sup> when a divine rampage fails to recognize national borders.  Other cults find they might as well not have bothered.  Consider the case of Qoph, the Kingslandian cultic deity of inscrutability and becoming a hollow shell of yourself.  Although Qoph's worshippers spoke of a terrible fate should his worship ever cease, the cult died out in AES 722 after a critical mass of cultists became too depressed to attend services, and so far nothing has happened.  Society has progressed, the economy has industrialized, and every measurable statistic of well-being has increased.  Which I suppose only goes to show that you can't take the word of crazed cultists at face value.</p>

<p>So the argument goes like this: everything tends toward unity and interconnectedness.  The more we centralize stuff, the fewer problems we have.  Centralization increases as time goes on.  Therefore, everything's going to turn out okay in the end.  So yeah, that argument?  Bullshit, all of it.  In reality, civilization's been going downhill since the invention of the nation-state.</p>
<p>That invention was called <b>the Partitioning</b>.  When the Partitioning went down, the <u>Guild of Mapmakers</u><sup>2</sup> had just been formed, and they were spreading their tendrils out all over the place to figure out how to represent the world.  And they were trying to deal with this issue of how do you look at the map and know who's in charge of a particular piece of land?  Hospitality culture was big back then—not anymore, of course, because everything goes to shit—and you had to know who you were bringing guest-gifts for. </p>
<p>So the Guild tried writing down the names of the big nations in the general area they were known to control.  This turns out not to work, since national land control ebbs and flows all the time.  So they went "fuck it" and just drew these big lines all over the map.  Bam, now <i>this</i> side is <u>Selestei</u><sup>3</sup> and <i>that</i> side is <u>Ulgrav</u><sup>4</sup>.  Easy peasy.</p>
<p>Problem is, before the Partitioning, no one gave a shit about who owned the land.  They cared about who owned what was <i>on</i> the land.  If you're an ancient Ulgravian horseprince, your main pre-Partition concerns look like this: "We need water.  Who do I kill to secure this river?  Should I have the horde graze on this hill?  How do we get around that <u>ominous floating cube</u><sup>5</sup>?"  But after the Partition, all of a sudden there's this invisible line down the middle of your grazing plains, and if you cross it King Musclebrain the Painfully Loud sends the <u>Grim Weepers</u><sup>6</sup> after you.</p>
<p>I always get pissed off by these soft-skulled armchair theorists who hail the Partitioning as a great thing because it eliminated the constant tribal war.  Tribal wars are small and over concrete, finite things like water.  But after you invent states, it becomes possible to go to war because your fucking Sovereign <u>isn't satisfied with the size of his genitalia</u><sup>7</sup>.  Have you ever <i>met</i> a Sovereign who was secure in their genitalia size?  It was a fucking mistake to let states own land and we should undo the whole thing.</p>

The War of Durun's Ass</p><p>When the Guild drew up the first maps with national borders on them, which formed the basis for subsequent territorial claims, a curious problem emerged. The borders themselves took up a nonzero amount of space on the map, leading troublemakers to ask who owned the land on which the borders were drawn. Despite the Guild's best efforts to draw the maps large and the borders thin, these border corridors ("borridors") could be miles wide in some places. This was handled in a variety of ways across the globe. On <u>the Careless Continent</u><sup>1</sup>, national borders were too ephemeral to matter. Once <u>Lepazzia</u><sup>2</sup> drifted off the continent, its new neighbors across the ocean simply ceded the new borridors to Lepazzian control rather than attempt to face the withering Lepazzian passive-aggression that would accompany trying to negotiate their use. Similarly, the borridors around Kingsland are generally left alone, but that's mostly because nobody wants to get any closer to Kingsland than necessary.</p>

Not literally immortal, you understand—<u>Selesteine</u><sup>1</sup> records put his death in AES 698 during a particularly brutal engagement with <u>a giant sea lizard</u><sup>2</sup>—but there are so many tales of his heroic deeds that he stands next to Sels in the national mythology of Selestei.  For some academics, this has given him something of a reputation for telling tall tales, as many of those myths come directly out of his scholarly work.  These academics are clearly not memetosociologists, and are therefore completely missing the point.   Of course the stories are not true.  Lannogaster himself would surely agree, if doing so wouldn't diminish the impact of the stories.  The point of his stories is that they illustrate key facets of Selesteine culture through the character that Lannogaster created for himself.</p></div>
<p>Take, for example, the story where Lannogaster led his company of <u>Grim Weepers</u><sup>3</sup> on a bloody rampage through the <u>Fractured Cities</u><sup>4</sup> with kegs of heavybeer serving as their sole weapons, fortifications, and sustenance.  It is unlikely that events traspired exactly as Lannogaster depicted them—although archeological findings from the <u>War of Durun's Ass</u><sup>5</sup> have uncovered keg marks on the ruins of the old gates.  More likely the Grim Weepers used a heavybeer keg as a battering ram and Lannogaster used that moment to characterize the whole military campaign.  In doing so, he highlights Selesteine hardiness, the simplicity of their life, and the Selesteines' peculiar inventiveness when it comes to improvised weapons.</p>
<p>The Lannogastrian approach to history passed on to his disciples, who immortalized his death in the epic poem <i>Pentex Skullcracker versus the Gigora the Terrible Sea Lizard</i>.  The poem describes him taking such impossible feats as leaping up buildings to get a better shot at the monster's face or, in my favorite passage of the poem, dying midway through the poem only to beat up Death and return to the fight.  Such an attitude has its downsides, however: the international scholarly community tends to dismiss Selesteine historians, and Selesteine politicians have gotten into trouble before because they had been taught a version of events that was not reflected anywhere outside of Selesteine history textbooks.  But such incidents usually just result in good-natured brawls, and one could make the argument that, in a way, that makes for a fitting legacy for Pentex Skullcracker.  He was a man for whom battles were a way to make history and history an excuse to brag about previous battles.  And, of course, he is due great respect for being the most successful memetosociologist ever to live.</p>

It did not exist until a tense vote in AES 877, when <u>Lepazzia</u><sup>1</sup> found itself the deciding vote for giving majority to a measure it disliked concerning Assembly procedure. Rather than do something so uncharacteristic as vote against a measure she was not in favor of, the Lepazzian sovereign, Sarah the Quick, instead told the Secretary that there was one more vote against that hadn't been counted yet. The Secretary was confused when Sarah gestured to a hastily-written nametag on the seat next to her that read "PLACEHOLDER", but faced with the prospect of trying to argue with the sovereign of Lepazzia, the Secretary simply acceded and announced the failure of the motion. Because the nametag had been badly written, the name of the country was recorded as "Placeholden". Once the measure's failure was in the books, it became impossible to question the existence and legitimacy of this new country without raising the question of whether the procedural measure should have been in force all this time. Moreover, because it was a procedural measure, raising questions about it would raise questions about every proceeding of the Assembly since 877. Given this, nobody has objected to the permanent reservation of the seat next to Lepazzia, and Placeholden has been marked as an abstention in the votes since then.</p></div>
<p>Despite existing only on paper, Placeholden is at war with every other country on the planet. When the original campus of the Disputatious Assembly was built, the primary meeting hall was built next to a courtyard that had been located around an <u>ominous cube</u><sup>2</sup>. However, over the centuries, the cube has gradually drifted towards the meeting hall due to continental drift. In 931, the cube began pressing up against the outer wall, and in 932 the structure gave way during a summer session of the Assembly. Someone suggested sabotage, and the Assembly passed a motion declaring war on whoever was at fault. Because nobody knew who was responsible, the war declaration had "PLACEHOLDER" written in for the name &mdash; much like the first time, in poor handwriting, resulting in the declaration being notarized as a declaration of war against Placeholden. Because Placeholden does not exist, this war was the only world conflict left unsolved by the <u>Massively Parallel Peace Conference</u><sup>3</sup>. <u>The Hegemony</u><sup>4</sup> blamed the failure of the MPPC to end the Placeholden War on <u>Flandrean</u><sup>5</sup> interference.</p>
<p>It is currently in vogue to claim that the <u>Missing Sea</u><sup>6</sup> is actually Placeholden territory, but this suggestion is not taken seriously, despite my best efforts, and has yet to rise to the level of being officially addressed the Assembly.</p>

Should I tell you of the heroic lengths to which he went for the sake of his students? Of the nights he spent poring over the bleeding edge of psychological research to formulate his <u>unique style of teaching</u><sup>1</sup>? Of the long and dangerous voyages he made around the world to collect specimens for his art? Of the eye he lost to a Barcuvian laserlily, or the two fingers to a rage-hamster? Surely any familiar with the alleged professor's name knows of such things. Instead, I will tell you of his character.</p></div>
<p>Marvin Fitch was born in AES 930 in <u>Flandre</u><sup>2</sup>, where he grew up an absolute bastard. He graduated with an alleged degree in education from the National University of <u>Incendia</u><sup>3</sup> in 953 through the University's Alleged Scholars Program, which offered faster, cheaper university education without university-sponsored accreditation or ethics courses. He began teaching as an adjunct at the University of Eyesland, where he was sanctioned twice in the fall semester and ultimately fired in the spring after one of his students lost a hand to an exam with a buzzsaw on it. This reoccurred at his next position at the Panark Jungle College the following year, and then again at his <i>next</i> position at his alma mater, where he taught several courses in the ASP. Surprisingly, however, NUI did not fire him, and he remained there as an alleged professor until 960, when <u>the I'll Legislate It, I Swear, Don't Think I Won't Act</u><sup>4</sup> forced him to rethink his career. In revenge, he invented the <u>Omega Point Coffee Secretor</u><sup>5</sup>, which currently resides in the Butterfly Effect Advisory Committee's break room, then went under the radar to teach trade skills.</p>
<p>After Incendia caught on fire in 974, the Incendian Bureau of Inquisition, Igirio Fezz, placed the blame (internally, of course, as Incendia does not officially recognize that anything bad has happened) on graduates from the Alleged Scholars Program, which he alleged had failed to teach its students even of the concept of safety precautions. The President, Iyano Niir, put Marvin Fitch on the top of Incendia's Most Wanted List and sent the military on a global manhunt to track the professor (allegedly) down. Fitch quickly dropped off the map. His whereabouts are currently unknown, though it is likely that he, like many political refugees, is hiding out somewhere in <u>the Panark Fleet</u><sup>6</sup>.</p>

Note that he is not actually a professor; his parents were just very hopeful.  McKinley is best known for braving the <u>Razor Valley</u><sup>1</sup> region <i>on purpose</i>, despite not being a native of <u>Selestei</u><sup>2</sup>.  His account of that expedition, along with other perilous exploits such as hunting the <u>electric undead</u><sup>3</sup> and wrestling a <u>Ravenous Squid-Tree</u><sup>4</sup>, are recounted in his memoir <i>Hazard Is My Middle Name</i>.</p></div>
<p>Born to Charles and Junia McKinley in 963, young Professor showed a great affinity for the natural world, which he attributes to spending a great deal of time with his dog Rupert.  His peers noted that his personality and mannerisms were much more suited to the culture of Selestei than his native <u>Shaster</u><sup>5</sup>.  McKinley, however, was not deterred by his differences, and those who knew him in those times maintain that by the time he reached adulthood he was extremely well-liked by all who met him.</p>
<p>While McKinley did not ultimately seek the academic career his parents had hoped for him, he has maintained a cordial relationship with the academy.  His writing, initially published in newspaper columns before moving to respected journals, has helped raise public awareness of key issues affecting the environment and conservation activism.  In respect of his achievements, the National University of Shaster awarded him an honorary degree in <u>biosphere fascism</u><sup>6</sup> in AES 988.  My contacts in the memetosociology department over there tell me that this move was partly so they could convince him to come teach there, but he's gone on record saying that he'd sooner give up hunting than take a desk job.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, for someone who hates desk jobs, McKinley has made a respectable academic showing.  Though he has his detractors, particularly those who attack anyone who supports the environment (<i>cough Gwen cough</i>), the broader academic community has responded positively to his work.  Some biofascists are even beginning to consider his 990 paper "Bludgeoning With Facts: An investigation of the limits of metaphor" to be a landmark in the field, although of course it is too early to say whether that will hold up in the years to come.</p>
<p>Recently, McKinley has made waves with the announcement that he is attempting to tame <u>fisher crows</u><sup>7</sup>. While this would be noteworthy in its own right, his stated intent is to train them to hunt poachers, thus preserving the integrity of Razor Valley.  It is unknown how this plan would affect the Selesteine custom of abandoning their youths in the middle of the Valley once they come of age at 16.</p>

<p></p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>Qualified spontaneous evaporation</h2><p>Kingsland is not a particularly popular tourist destination. Most of the city's attractions are deadly to the unwary, if the <u>transit system</u><sup>1</sup> doesn't get you first. Sometimes, people do visit for diplomatic or academic reasons, but they're rarely the sightseeing type and they leave as soon as they're done. It's a rare breed that comes to our grave city to visit, but they do come sometimes. But if you ever find yourself afflicted by madness and decide to visit Kingsland, we <i>do</i> have some things worth an eyeful. There's our historic bridges across the river through the middle of the city (don't cross the middle one), a nice ice cream truck (assuming you catch it before the horrors chasing it do), and a park in Southside with a nice fountain (if you don't mind blood). I'd suggest getting a tour from a local friend, since the offices of the Kingsland Board of Tourism consist of a sign with "TURN BACK WHILE YOU CAN" written in an unidentifiable liquid.</p></div>
<p>If you're feeling stupid (we don't say "brave" here), you can go on a statuary tour, where you'll hear about <b>qualified spontaneous evaporation</b>. Every now and then in Kingsland, someone just evaporates. This isn't usually a remarkable occurrence. However, sometimes they only <i>partially</i> evaporate, like they were put on pause somehow, and the remains become fixtures as immovable as the <u>ominous cubes</u><sup>2</sup>. We haven't figured out what's behind it, and we're not interested. What we do instead is build pedestals underneath them and spray-paint them gray. This results in some pretty oddly placed statues, which makes the statuary tour interesting, if running for your life through the streets of Kingsland wasn't interesting enough. Some of them block roads, but you can usually drive on the walls to get around them. Be sure not to miss the statue of Yphydryx Shadowhand, the prophet of the <u>Tesseraction</u><sup>3</sup>, who began evaporating in the middle of being thrown off of a clock tower by his followers and subsequently froze in midair. The 20-meter pedestal up to his falling form is visible from almost any open area in Kingsland, providing a constant reminder to her citizens of the folly of hope.</p>
<p>QSE doesn't always hit one of us, though. Sometimes good things happen, and one of the many local horrors evaporates instead. (It's unwise to stop running to celebrate, since this usually gets one picked off by something else.) We actually managed to use a QSE-frozen <u>squid-tree</u><sup>4</sup> as a support to build a new bridge last year. This turned out to be less useful than expected, since the other squid-trees around it weren't so indisposed.</p>

Some of  them eventually leave due to disagreements with the positions I've advanced or some of the <u>didactic techniques</u><sup>1</sup> I've been known to use. This is just part of being a controversial academician. But through all the heated discussions, occasional fistfights, and pitched legal battles, what makes it all worth it &mdash; to me &mdash; is the rare student of mine who takes what I have to say to heart and goes on to make something beautiful out of it. I once mentored one Laura Bennett, whom I now say unabashedly is my favorite student of all the ones I've had so far. Bennett, now known by her official title, <b>Queen Beneficent the Plenitudinous</b>, was the daughter of the president of the Democratic Republic of Mizzin, a small country in the <u>Iurezzan</u><sup>2</sup> south. Her father was opposed to her studying under a <u>misosopher</u><sup>3</sup>, but he warmed up to the idea when she began giving him policy proposals and recommending decisive government actions that helped solidify his power base among the Mizzinic Parliament. In 986, for her senior thesis, she submitted to me the plans for, and then carried out, a military coup that had her seize power from her father and become the first Queen of the newly-established Autocratic Plenitude of Mizzin. It remains the only thesis to which I've given full marks.</p></div>
<p>Having a despot as an alumna has been interesting for the NCUI. On one hand, her brutal suppression of dissent is questionable in light of the university's honor code, and it sets a bad example, I'm told, for the other students. On the other hand, the <u>ProjExpo 975</u><sup>4</sup> organizers who threw our dean out of the convention were in Mizzin when the Queen seized power, and nobody's seen them since. </p>
<p>There is one area where Bennett and I cannot not come to an agreement, however. She has <i>terrible</i> taste in shows. Whenever I visit Mizzin, we grab a few bottles of wine and watch trashy romcoms in our pajamas in the royal private theater. I can enjoy those sorts of things ironically, and I can even have a good time of it with enough wine in me. But the Queen seems to enjoy them <i>unironically</i>, and it just confounds me to no end. I know she's well-read, because her thesis was full of references to ancient philosophers and classic literature. Maybe it's just a generational thing?</p>

During <u>the Partitioning</u><sup>3</sup>, rather than formally decide where in the Valley the border runs, the <u>Guild of Mapmakers</u><sup>4</sup> simply smudged the border line in that region. This has become standard cartographic convention, because neither country particularly wants the place. Consequently, Razor Valley is a legal gray area where neither Selesteine nor Shastrian law clearly applies, much like international waters were before <u>the Hegemony of Whales</u><sup>5</sup> claimed all of the oceans as sovereign territory. It is telling that "extradition from Razor Valley" is a turn of phrase indicating something that requires too much effort to be worth the little, if any, benefit it provides.</p></div>
<p>The region remains sparsely populated because of its unique flora and fauna. Its name comes from the ubiquitous razorgrass, so named because its blades are literally swords. The evolutionary reasons for this are not well understood. Perhaps the most well-known animal native to Razor Valley is the <u>marionette crow</u><sup>6</sup>, which uses its spindly tentacles to safely handle the exploding fruit that grow on the region's flaming trees. Other animals, like the death cow, simply evolved robust enough constitutions that they can eat whatever plants in the region they want, whether they be swords, on fire, or both. The inexplicability of the Razor Valley biome has led to numerous comparisons with the <u>climate of Barcu</u><sup>7</sup>, but ecologists have been unable thus far to find any connection between the two. <u>Grantham's Law</u><sup>8</sup> is often invoked, but Razor Valley clearly falls outside of its scope. Some have attempted to bridge this gap by claiming that the ecology of the Valley <i>is</i> aquatic, and the water is just <u>missing</u><sup>9</sup>.</p>
<p>Despite the unforgiving environment, Razor Valley is nevertheless the home of a small population. Settlements in Razor Valley are either highly mobile or highly defensible. Those who opt for mobility, like many of the criminal groups hiding out in the area, must remain on the move constantly in order to avoid roving murders of marionette crows or the death cow Moolossus, who is inexplicably ten meters tall and always furious. Normally these groups are wiped out within a year due to inexperience. Those who opt for defense, like Razor Valley Bunker-University, make use of a veritable <u>Flandrean</u><sup>10</sup> number of deterrents and defense mechanisms. Entrance to and egress from these settlements is generally a laborious process that can take around a full day. Some attempts were made to dig tunnels for easier travel between settlements and in and out of the region. These soon became infested by spidermoles. The project has been tabled until sufficient defenses can be drawn up.</p>

The chief participants were <u>Selestei</u><sup>1</sup> and <u>Flandre</u><sup>2</sup>, with some involvement by the <u>Fractured Cities</u><sup>3</sup>.  There was a noticeable absence of involvement from the Boslavian Hegemony (ancestor to the <u>Principality of Shaster</u><sup>4</sup>) and, argue some scholars, from common sense.</p></div>
<p>As Dr. Jones notes in his article on <i><u>Iurezza</u><sup>5</sup></i> (not to be confused with Dr. Jones's article on <u>Iurezza</u><sup>6</sup>), the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns began life as a Flandrean contingency plan on the west coast of Iurezza.  Its intent was to give the political leaders of the area a forum where they could mediate their disagreements without escalating to war.  However, this vision failed to anticipate King Doric Foeslayer of Selestei.  On his first visit to the Assembly in AES 25, King Doric challenged three different Sovereigns to wrestling matches and generally raised havoc in the hall.  Then he jovially threatened to leave and return with an army.</p>
<p>High Exarch Kantamon, who had created the Assembly and was now faced with a threat to its legacy, knew he had to remove the boisterous Sovereign as a threat in whatever manner he could.  Initially he attempted to goad King Doric into irritating Sornhandr, King Eternal, but—and this is where I suspect someone has tampered with the historical record—contemporary accounts indicate that King Doric charmed the old lich and the two of them went out drinking without King Doric succumbing to the curse of the <u>electric undead</u><sup>7</sup>.</p>
<p>His first plan having failed, High Exarch Kantamon received an unexpected blessing in the form of <u>Zor Olo</u><sup>8</sup> cracking and <u>a large portion of the ocean vanishing</u><sup>9</sup> within eyeshot of the Assembly hall.  Drawing from legends of the <u>Ultimate Dragonopolis</u><sup>10</sup>, Kantamon procured some falsified maps of the Roerbach region of southern Iurezza.  He then gave an exhortation to the Assembly that there were dragons nesting in southern Iurezza, and that they had struck at the moon.  He put special emphasis on how dangerous they were, and how brave the warriors challenging them would have to be.  King Doric, of course, immediately volunteered his armies.</p>
<p>While the Selesteine dragon-hunting fleet sailed south, High Exarch Kantamon sailed east.  He traveled to the <u>Fractured Cities</u><sup>11</sup> and murdered a succession of Hierarchs in <u>bloodmoots</u><sup>12</sup> by dropping anvils on their heads, then forged a coalition of Fractured Cities militaries to invade Selestei.  By the time they succeeded, of course, the coalition had already broken into no less than eleven factions, but as Selestei was bearing the cost of their infighting, Kantamon's objective had already been achieved.  It would be centuries before either Selestei or the surrounding region recovered.</p>
<p>King Doric, meanwhile, failed to find any dragons, and moreover was misled by false maps.  The Selesteine expedition, increasingly frustrated by the lack of dragons to slay, slaughtered their way through eight hundred miles of untamed wilderness before crossing the Skeptical Channel into the <u>Careless Continent</u><sup>13</sup>.  Their sudden appearance there disrupted a delicate peace sixty years in the making, throwing the entire continent back into infighting.</p>

It is a matter of national orthodoxy that while the world is a dangerous and uncertain place, there is nothing that cannot be overcome by the fire burning within the human spirit. Therefore, every day at sunrise, every Selesteine citizen wakes up and yells at the sun. There is often forceful pointing, and if the country is having a holiday, occasionally breaking things. Then everyone has a drink. The national beverage of Selestei is heavybeer, which inexplicably weighs several times more than a normal beer per liquid volume. All Selesteines grow up drinking heavybeer, which accounts why virtually all of them are extraordinarily strong.</p></div>
<p>Despite their aggressive extroversion, or perhaps because of it, Selestei is a very easygoing country when it comes to international politics. In centuries past, the Selestei military was feared, and rightly so. The dreaded <u>Grim Weepers</u><sup>1</sup> once carved a bloody swath across <u>the Fractured Cities</u><sup>2</sup>, fueled in their relentless conquest by the maddening pain of eating only spicy food. Today, however, Selestei tends to play the gentle giant, with its sovereign, King Vincent Daggert, playing the life of the party at Disputatious Assembly afterparties. This gregariousness can sometimes transgress the boundaries of good taste, such as when King Daggert told <u>President Niir</u><sup>3</sup> that he was jealous of Incendia ("MAY MY HEART BURN AS BRIGHT AS YOUR COUNTRY ONE DAY!" were his exact words, if I recall). You could tell Niir was trying his best to maintain his composure for the sake of Incendia's official position on the literal dumpster fire the homeland had become, but you could also see him desperately eyeing the open bar.</p>
<p>Selesteine mythology attributes the nation's hot-blooded fervor to its founding hero, Sels. According to the legends, there were once two suns and two moons, which made it impossible for anybody to get any sleep. Sels, outraged at this, challenged the suns to send down the stronger of the two to fight him. The suns conferred, and the older of the two descended to do battle. The two of them fought for a full lunar month until Sels finally grappled the older sun and ate it. The other sun, afraid of Sels' fearsome power, began running around the world, creating the diurnal cycle. Sels, not one to let an opponent run from a fight, leapt into the heavens to pursue it, where he became the third and largest moon. Selesteines often suggest that the nation should destroy <u>Zor Olo</u><sup>4</sup>, the smallest of the three moons, for being unworthy to share the sky with Sels. So far, nobody is sure whether they're being serious  or deadpan, and Daggert changes the topic whenever someone asks about it.</p>

<p>1. Grim Weepers<br>2. The Fractured Cities<br>3. Incendia<br>4. Zor Olo</p><p>Yelling at the sun is an ancient and venerable tradition in Selestei, but it acquired a tint of patriotism when the country entered the Disputatious Assembly and was asked to register an official national anthem. Thus, at occasions when the national anthem of a sovereign's country is played, when the King of Selestei's turn comes, a band of Selesteines come out and scream into the heavens. This is very popular with crowds, whom the King encourages to join in.</p>

<p></p><p>The Selesteines' indomitable spirit and inability to back down from a challenge has gotten them burned before, particularly by some of the craftier nations (I won't name names).  For example, the <u>Roerbach Incident</u><sup>1</sup> left the entire Selesteine military abroad on a dragon-hunting quest.  I asked King Daggert off the record how he would deal with a modern attempt to trick his military out of position while an invasion tried to take his country.  He just laughed.  "Pity the invaders," he said.  "They would have to face our women."</p>
<p>I confess I'm not familiar with enough military lore to evaluate his strategy, but you certainly can't fault his confidence.</p>

<p>1. The Roerbach Incident</p><p>Despite its militarily aggressive history, modern Selestei is actually quite a charming place to visit. The weather at the major vacation destinations is temperate, which the locals attribute to intimidating the climate into submission. When I visited many years back, I had one of the best curries I've had in my life in the city market. I was a little embarrassed to order the minimum spice level, but the lady running the stall could tell I was a foreigner and insisted. I tried to convince her that it was no use and that sociophysical principles would make it more or less spicy according to expectation, but in the end I'm glad I took her advice, because <i>damn</i> was that a hot curry. According to my wife, I was mumbling in my sleep all night about contracting <u>jalapeñosis</u><sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>Of course, Selesteine cuisine isn't all spicy food, whatever legends of their <u>elite troops</u><sup>2</sup> might suggest. There's a city in the north of the country famous for its pastries, which food critics attribute partially to the recipe and partially to how well the dough is kneaded. The bakeries are all located near a military base, and the soldiers there knead the dough by practicing hand-to-hand combat on it. They have a festival every year where they bake swords and shields out of bread, which the children of the town use to stage mock battles.</p>

<p>1. Jalapeñosis<br>2. Grim Weepers</p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>Shaster</h2><p>If the <b>Principality of Shaster</b> had a national motto, it would probably be "Hold my beer!"  The nation as a whole seems to thrive on finding new approaches to any given problem, regardless of whether or not the problem is of any importance or, indeed, has already been solved.  I'm thinking particularly of Project SpaceGills, a national scientific undertaking that aimed to genetically modify everyone on <u>Taurus Research Station</u><sup>1</sup> "in order that they might breathe the purity of space."  This caused something of an international uproar when Phase 3 of testing involved opening the airlock and letting all the air out so they could be sure the gills were working; tensions increased further when it emerged that no one on the station had ever consented to the genetic modification.  Sadly, this led to the expulsion of all Shastrian personnel from the station, prematurely ending their promising <u>space persuasion</u><sup>2</sup> project.</p></div>
<p>Shastrian culture celebrates new and cutting-edge technology, despite the fact that so little of what they produce is actually workable.  Their culture's understanding of itself is that they are more forward-thinking than other nations, a claim they ground by pointing to enormous national research and development costs.  For memetosociologists like my esteemed colleague M. Hon. Milton, however, there is an interesting layer to these claims, as the average citizen has little to do with the national obsession.  At the end of the day, if your toaster doesn't actually work, you'll import a working one from elsewhere.</p>
<p>Thus, Shastrian patriotism is subtly intertwined with an understanding that some person, somewhere else in the country, is actually doing the important work.  The average citizen believes the National University of Shaster is the epicenter of new and exciting technologies, while staff at the University tend to believe the exciting stuff is happening in a different department.  Moreover, an analysis by the <u>Stratsky Foundation for Economics and Insurrection</u><sup>3</sup> found that the research and development money is split between two streams: one that funds research deals with more advanced countries (e.g. <u>the Contagious Republic of Paul Vigotski</u><sup>4</sup>), and one that <u>inexplicably vanishes somewhere in the university</u><sup>5</sup>.</p>
<p>On the political side of things, Shaster enjoys an extremely competent diplomatic staff, which has secured them many alliances and an enviable position in global politics despite a comparative lack of technological or military power to back them up.  Shastrian diplomats were instrumental in resolving the <u>Goats on Boats Affair</u><sup>6</sup> that threatened to plunge the world into conflict.  It is perhaps for this reason that they are able to thrive as a country despite their neighbors being somewhat unruly.  But even more impressive is their ability, as a coastal nation, to maintain tight diplomatic ties with the <u>Panark Fleet</u><sup>7</sup> without harming their relationship with the <u>Hegemony of Whales</u><sup>8</sup>.</p>

The Hegemony of Whales</p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>Space persuasion</h2><p><b>Space persuasion</b> is an ambiguous term that can refer to one of two related concepts.</p></div>
<p>The concept of space persuasion in the sense of <i>the persuasion of space</i> is an old theme in folk superstition, related to the idea of a sacred space, but more general and usually related to the behavior of physics. Unlike a <i>genius loci</i>, a persuaded space is not different by virtue of something distinct from the space that dwells there, but rather has some quality in and of itself. The quality or different operation, whatever it is, is woven into the fabric of the universe, so to speak. This makes space persuasion a mainstay of the sort of popular literature that astounds the reader by its seeming profundity more than its basis in fact. Space persuasion is often invoked to explain <u>Barcuvian antiweather</u><sup>1</sup> and appealed to as a link between the morose character of Kingslanders and the various phenomena that make it a hellhole to live in. The baselessness of this pop-sci is clear: if the <u>concerted will</u><sup>2</sup> of Kingslanders really could persuade space, it'd be the nicest place in the world.</p>
<p>These days, a year doesn't go by that someone doesn't suggest that <u>symphonic warp traversal</u><sup>3</sup> runs off of space persuasion. This widespread myth is helped along by the rumor that the song sung by <u>the Hegemony's</u><sup>4</sup> <u>Chorus Perpetual</u><sup>5</sup> is what keeps the planet in its orbit. The baselessness of this, too, is clear, since whales evolved after the planet came into its orbit.</p>
<p>This older sense of space persuasion gave birth to the other, newer sense when the illustrious <u>Dr. Stafford</u><sup>6</sup> remarked that a number of political issues would be solved if the campus of the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns were persuaded to throw itself into space. This remark, which became so popular for a brief time that the Assembly tied the building down just in case, introduced a sense of space persuasion as <i>persuasion via space</i>, i.e., persuasion by threatening to launch someone into space. It's not a coincidence that the <u>Taurus Research Station</u><sup>7</sup> was established within decades of this. In fact, recent declassifications have revealed that there actually <i>was</i> research into space persuasion going on up there &mdash; and surprisingly, into both types. I guess they thought they had a better chance at persuading space if there's not as much occupying its attention. Personally, I hope they can resume the research some day, because persuading the Committee building to keep itself clean would save me a lot of work.</p>

In fact, it's probably the only one in the top five; the next four backed off it give it some room.</p></div>
<p>Founded in AES 876 by Anton Stratsky as the <i>Strastsky Foundation for Economics</i>, the Foundation's original mandate was to help manage the struggling logistics of the <u>Compass Republic</u><sup>1</sup>.  That right there is probably why things turned out the way they did.  Pretend you're an economist, and you've got a bunch of equations where one set of numbers greases the wheels and the other set dumps a bucket of wrenches in the machinery and burns the whole fucking country down.  Yeah, yeah, I know it's a mixed metaphor, shut the fuck up.</p>
<p>Point is, within ten years, <u>His Dread Majesty</u><sup>2</sup> is knocking on the front door and asking for some help with a rival in the Assembly.  The economists shrug—it's just a different set of numbers for them—and get to work.  By <u>891</u><sup>3</sup>, global trade is a flaming dumpster fire, the <u>Panark Fleet</u><sup>4</sup>'s on the verge of implosion, <u>Selestei</u><sup>5</sup>'s declared war on livestock in general, and <u>Shaster</u><sup>6</sup>'s named economics a <u>pentad</u><sup>7</sup> field because <i>how else do you explain all this fucking witchcraft?</i></p>
<p>You gotta admire the pair on Dr. Stratsky.  Amid international calls for his Foundation to be disbanded, he goes and fucking rebrands as the <i>Stratsky Foundation for Economics and Insurrection</i>.  The surge of notoriety put the Foundation on the map for every pentad academic from the Double-North Pole to the <u>planet's ass</u><sup>8</sup>.  Applications tripled over the next two years and then doubled over the following decade, which of course only pissed off the global community even further.  It's only gotten worse.  Hell, <u>Ulgrav</u><sup>9</sup> was even threatening to bomb them a couple decades back until Santanna bribed us with a trade deal.  But it probably wouldn't have gone any further than threats, because no one wants to have to deal with their exports drying up and their imports suffering massive price inflation.</p>
<p>Today, the Stratsky Foundation remains the only advanced degree program for economists looking to pursue their bloody work.  Not for lack of trying, of course, but the main problem with trying to compete in this field is that your competitor is the Stratsky Foundation for Economics and Insurrection.  Of the last four attempts to start an economics foundation, three went broke right off the bat, while the fourth experienced an uprising by the staff, who cornered the president and, according to local reports, "stabbed him to death with their pens."</p>

The Ulgravian Diaspora</p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>Symphonic warp traversal</h2><p>One thing that I really think we need to consider is that if we move countries around because of the Disarrangement Act, it's not strictly necessary that all of them have to stay on Planet Earth.  If we go down that road, then the technology of choice for doing so is undoubtedly <b>symphonic warp traversal</b>.  First devised by the mad inventor Rime Grimes, SWT is a technological marvel whose foundational principles researchers have yet to uncover.  But the basic theory is simple to explain: an orchestra is positioned in front of an acoustic capture device, which then feeds the sound into what Grimes called a "Grimer Primer," which communicates that information to an engine.  Scientists have discovered it is possible but rarely wise to deviate from Grimes's engine design, even though it is admittedly alarming to rely on a lightspeed engine composed entirely out of cardboard, duct tape, and rubber bands.</p></div>
<p>Researchers have found much greater success by varying the kind of music that is played into the Grimer Primer.  While Grimes's notes insist that classical music is "THE way to go, my chummy chums," early warp experiments ran into materiel problems because most governments refused to risk the national symphonic orchestra in a perilous space experiment.  This reluctance stalled warp research for several years until researchers from Katskria (one of of the <u>Very Definitely Independent States</u><sup>1</sup>) hired a <u>neoclassical metal band</u><sup>2</sup>, which was deemed sufficiently expendable that the experiments could continue.  Since then, warp researchers have tried many genres, discovering that the quality of warp travel is tied to qualities of the music played:</p>
<p>• Classical music typically makes for the smoothest ride, although smooth jazz tends to do better at this</p>
<p>• Rock or metal lend themselves to faster, if bumpier, travel</p>
<p>• Punk rock has the unnerving propensity to send the ship in the wrong direction entirely</p>
<p>• The one recorded use of dubstep in a symphonic warp traversal device destroyed the ship entirely</p>
<p>In addition to the pre-existing genres, <u>Vigotskian</u><sup>3</sup> researchers aboard <u>Taurus Research Station</u><sup>4</sup> are reportedly in the process of developing a new genre of music, "warp trance," specifically suited for warp travel.  It is certain to be a harrowing process, and I am sure we all wish them well.</p>
<p>One concluding note: many lay people are afraid that warp travel might lead to the destruction of the Earth, reasoning that a spaceship travelling at faster-than-light speeds is essentially a massive bullet that could shatter the planet.  I just did the math, and I have concluded that they are absolutely right, and we should all fear for our lives.  But life is so busy and we all have so much to do, so I recommend limiting your stupefying terror to no more than fifteen minutes per day.</p>

<p>1. The Very Definitely Independent States<br>2. The Lunchtime Fallacy<br>3. The Contagious Republic of Paul Vigotski<br>4. Taurus Research Station</p><p>This shit always gets me going.  Do you know where they got that idea?  From <u>Ulgrav</u><sup>1</sup>.  There's a paper from one of our researchers a year or two before the VDIS experiments where the author (don't remember the name, fuck i'm drunk) suggests trying different genres of music to see what happens.  Up comes this fucker from <u>Velskyavo</u><sup>2</sup>, who walks into, into, fuck.  Whatever.  Walks into the researcher's lab and says "Hey dude"—wait, Jameson, that was the guy's name—says "Hey Jameson, you working on anything cool?"  Jameson says "Fuck yeah, dude, wanna see?"  Velsky fucker says "Totally, dude," then shoots him and all of his lab assistants and walks off with all his shit.  So now the history books say that warp travel came out of the VDIS, which is completely missing the fuckign point.</p>
<p>You know why Ulgrav was researching warp travel?  Because we <i>need some fucking land</i>, and we're desperate enough that we'll take it on other planets if we have to.</p>

<p>1. The Ulgravian Diaspora<br>2. National Academy of Velskyavo</p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>Taurus Research Station</h2><p>Possibly hanging right over your head <i>right at this very moment</i>, the <b>Taurus Research Station</b> is an orbital scientific and planetary defense platform built by the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns in AES 940.  Don't let the name fool you—the only research they're doing up there is how much toxic waste they can shove into their weapons systems before the gravitational stabilizers break and the whole fucking mess disintegrates into a radioactive cloud of poison in our atmosphere.</p></div>
<p>The Taurus Research Station <i>used</i> to be an actual research station back in the 40's and 50's, but then along came <u>General Kade "Ripper" Gorson</u><sup>1</sup> and the Flandrean military.  Asshole got up in front of the Disputatious Assembly and gave a big speech about how we're probably less advanced than aliens, so we need guns in space to shoot any aliens that come to get us.  I guess military goons stealing your base is just the price you pay for trying to do some science in an out-of-the-way corner of the world.  </p>
<p>Anyways, the last decent publication out of the TRS was Gadner's paper on <u>space persuasion</u><sup>2</sup> back in '78.  It could have been groundbreaking, but that was about when DAS Command made the station off-limits to everyone with civilian-level security clearance, so I guess we're back to square one until I can convince Milton to sociologize himself more security clearance.</p>
<p>Oh well, I guess we have to talk about the military side of things.  Technically, everything in space is falling, which is probably why everything about the Taurus Research Station has been going downhill.  During the 60's, all the DAS member nations brought their own weapons projects up to space and then nailed them piecemeal to the station.  That immediately caused a new problem, which was that the station's thrusters weren't rated for that kind of mass, meaning it started to sink back into the atmosphere.  </p>
<p>The goons did the math and realized it was going to come down over the ocean, which pissed off the <u>whales</u><sup>3</sup>.  Since the whole mess was Gorson's idea, the Hegemon argued it was a Flandrean conspiracy, despite the fact that the world is like 70% ocean and the affected area from the falling station is basically guaranteed to hit water <i>somewhere.</i>  Blubbery fuckers.  Anyways, that led to a round of everyone nailing their nationally-branded thrusters to the TRS, which in turn led to the realization that the station could maneuver itself around and point all those shiny new weapons at the planet.  The DAS was gonna order everyone off, but then someone pointed out that they all had space shuttles, so now the compromise is that everyone keeps a few soldiers up there to watch everyone else's soldiers.  Gee, that seems like a stable situation.</p>

The days are long, the light thin, the weather <u>irrational</u><sup>1</sup>, and the coast <u>inexplicably dry</u><sup>2</sup>; <u>living gods</u><sup>3</sup> walk, or possibly <u>drive</u><sup>4</sup>, the streets, and <u>dead mortals</u><sup>5</sup> roam the hills.  As such, it is little surprise that Kingslanders have such an affinity for the unknown and the ethereal.  If a transparent membrane cursed you out telepathically in Hantu and then dissolved the back wall of your apartment over the course of eleven hours before floating off without so much as a goodbye, is it really that much more outlandish when the hooded cultist on the nearest street corner demands your belief in Grislegrinder, the cosmic intestine-tentacled abomination who devours all upon death?</p></div>
<p>Belief in the Tesseraction is considered by scholars to have begun with the proselytizing of Yphydryx Shadowhand, whose cult rose to prominence in AES 380 before dissolving upon his death in AES 384.  However, in that mere handful of years, the Cult of the Shadowhand spread across nearly all of Kingsland.  Central in their thought was the idea of the Tesseraction: a mythical upcoming point in time wherein our world would burst from its three-dimensional shackles and partake in higher orders of being.  The popularity of the cult is rather easy to explain: Shadowhand taught that the abominations that plague Kingsland draw their power from other planes of existence, and if humans were able to access those planes as well, then they would be able to fight against the horrors on an even footing.  Once his control of the city was cemented, Shadowhand predicted that the Tesseraction would arrive in the late summer of the next year, when <u>Zor Olo</u><sup>6</sup> reached its peak.  According to historical sources, mood in the city was uncharacteristically high, and some poor fools even threw together premature hunting bands before vanishing forever into the city's dark alleys.</p>
<p>On the eve of the predicted Tesseraction, cultists all over the city prepared celebratory pre-ascension meals and readied their best weapons for what they believed was the upcoming slaughter.  But the next day, nothing happened.  Another group of cultists joined the first wave of victims in the alleys, figuring they'd somehow ascended despite not feeling different.  The rest, however, waited in mounting horror until Shadowhand said he got the year wrong and the Tesseraction was actually next year.  Come the next year, people made the celebratory dinners and gathered their weapons again—and were once again disappointed.  This cycle continued until Shadowhand <u>partially disappeared</u><sup>7</sup>.</p>
<p>Up to the present day, Kingslanders continue to celebrate <b>Tesseraction Eve</b> by making fine meals and letting their children play with (usually) toy weapons.  But in modern times the holiday has more of a last-meal-before-execution kind of atmosphere, as Kingslanders have collectively resigned themselves to the fact that nothing can save them from the horrors.</p>

They say of themselves that they took to the sky to embrace the flame of adventure, but scholarly consensus is that they were actually just <u>fleeing the passive-aggression of neighboring Lepazzia</u><sup>1</sup>.  (If possible, don't let Dr. Hanson see this.)</p></div>
<p>Ulgrav's role in contemporary geopolitics is a somewhat precarious one.  The sky has precious few resources beyond sunlight, water vapor, and the occasional bird.  Consequently, Ulgrav is entirely dependent upon their trade allies (primarily <u>Flandre</u><sup>2</sup> and <u>the Compass Republic</u><sup>3</sup>) for essentials like oil and raw materials.  At the same time, their control of airspace is nearly absolute.  The last country to challenge them directly was the Theocracy of Rime in AES 947, and nearly fifty years later they're still a collection of subsistence farmers after <u>what the Ulgravians did to them</u><sup>4</sup>.  So of course no country <i>really</i> feels safe when zeppelins are in their airspace, but no one wants to make a fuss of it either.</p>
<p>The unique situation of the Ulgravian Diaspora has also put them in a complicated position with respect to the Disarrangement Act.  Years of being cramped up on zeppelins and feeling like their homeland was taken from them has pushed the diaspora's general mood into bitterness and resentment.  Indeed, in meetings of the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns, the Ulgravian Sovereign can't help but let some of that bitterness slip inner his own manner.  So Ulgrav desperately wants the Act to pass so that they can get, in the words of my esteemed colleague Dr. Hanson, "some fucking land."  At the same time, the continued existence of their zeppelin fleet depends on oil trade with Flandre, which is highly motivated to prevent the Act from passing.  Even a brief review of the historical record will suffice to communicate that Flandre is, bar none, the worst country on the planet to double-cross.  Thus, Ulgrav has wisely chosen to speak against the Act for the time being.</p>
<p>Culturally, the Ulgravians are of course known for their barely repressed rage, but they also possess strong communal values.  This is likely a result of selection pressures, as anyone found guilty of egregious acts against the community is typically thrown off the airship.  Cultural critics sometimes observe that this practice is similar to their recreational activity called <u>windstriding</u><sup>5</sup>, wherein someone is thrown off the airship, except with a rope tied around them.  These critics typically suggest that both customs reflect their deep-seated need to escape their exile and return to their homeland.  However, as a memetosociologist, I would note that these critics are usually Ulgravians, and this analysis just serves to reinforce the country's standard propaganda line.  I would further note that there is really not that much to do onboard an airship, and they are probably all just bored.</p>

At a meeting of the Assembly yesterday, I watched <u>High Exarch Minor Ironheart</u><sup>1</sup> stroll across the Chamber of Sovereigns, whisper in the Ulgravian Sovereign's ear, then slam a knife through his desk before walking away.  The message seemed to be, "If you cross us and fail, you'd better hope <i>you</i> have a contingency plan."  Knowing you're in the crosshairs of the most paranoid nation on the planet is a good motivator to try your luck in other directions.</p>

<p>As far as "other directions" are concerned, I happen to know that the Sovereign received a diplomatic party from the <u>germs</u><sup>1</sup> the other week.  Flandre aside, their tech is the best on offer right now, with the <i>poooossible</i> exception of the <u>Panark Fleet</u><sup>2</sup>.  We're nominally allied with the Fleet, but one reason to pick the Vigotskians over the Fleet is if you're trying to look for alternate energy sources—the boatfuckers oppose the Act and they're mortal enemies with the <u>Hegemony</u><sup>3</sup>, so they've never had as much of an incentive to pursue that line of research.</p>
<p>If the Sovereign can land some kind of research deal and reduce our dependence on Flandrean oil, we might see some changes in the alliance.  At the very least, it'll be less of a headlock for us.</p>

<p></p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>Ultimate Dragonopolis</h2><p>So there's this thing in <u>Ulgravian</u><sup>1</sup> culture that most outsiders never catch on to.  The question is this: fast, or old?  Remember that we're a horse people with a rich sense of history who all live on zeppelins now.  As an Ulgravian, that puts you in one of two camps: either your ship has a ton of history, but its technical specs are shit; or it's modern and sleek but you've got no fucking history to ground yourself in, pun not fucking intended.  Or you have the shit luck to be born on the <i>Thunder Bumble</i>, which astoundingly has neither history nor half-decent specs, and do you know what a fucking pain in the ass it is to petition for a ship transfer in the Ulgravian Diaspora?</p></div>
<p>Anyway, so there's these ancient legends about the <b>Ultimate Dragonopolis</b>, the last city of the dragons.  And they seemed like pure myth for most of history, but ever since we invented space travel people are giving those myths another look and realizing that a lot of the details look an awful fucking lot like what you'd see on an atmosphere-capable space vessel.  But since academics have their head perpetually up their asses and/or in the sand, our biggest researcher on this topic is <u>a half-mad conspiracy theorist</u><sup>2</sup> with a vendetta against <u>the country that fucking gives us all affordable household goods</u><sup>3</sup>.  Worse, he's being bankrolled by the wireheads in fucking <u>Shaster</u><sup>4</sup>, who probably only want in because they want to feel like their country is actually relevant on the global stage.</p>
<p>You know who really needs an extra airship?  How about <i>the only country in the world that actually lives on airships?</i> The Ultimate Dragonopolis is huge, according the legends&mdash;hell, fucking dragons lived on it, what else would you expect?&mdash;and its tech level is beyond anything we've got, judging by the shit the dragons left behind in their <u>little antarctic getaway</u><sup>5</sup>. We'd treasure the shit outta that thing if we got our hands on it.  I mean, shit, the Ulgravians over on <i>Falcon of the Plains</i> go everywhere on the ship by swinging from monkey bars because it's carpeted in rugs belonging to the last Dragon Prince and they're too holy for anyone else to walk on.  Plus, we've got a claim to the dragonopolis.  The Ulgravians are the only people in the world who remember that horses are descended from dragons.  We fucking tamed them, and don't give me that shit about how no one outside of Ulgrav believes those accounts.  Probably wouldn't recognize a legitimate historical narrative if a <u>Selesteine</u><sup>6</sup> beat your face in with it.  So it stands to reason&mdash;not that any of you self-interested horsewives at the Assembly are gonna give more than the semblance of thought on this&mdash;that whatever the dragons had is now ours by right.</p>

Founded by Wren Felsdottor two hundred years before the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns, the Venerable Cartographers did pretty much what you would expect from the name.  The Guild filled a pressing and necessary function, as it was a time of ambiguity and conflict which thankfully de-escalated after the <u>invention of national borders</u><sup>1</sup> six years after the Guild was established.</p></div>
<p>Guilds were both influential and plentiful in those days, which meant individuals were incentivized to try and corner some niche section of the job market by founding their own Guild.  This resulted in, for example, a Guild of Blacksmithing While Reciting Edifying Poetry and a Guild of Stealing Other Guilds' Signs.  You may think I am exaggerating here, but I am not.  Both of these organizations are mentioned in historical records.  Needless to say that none of these Guilds persisted, with the notable exceptions of the <u>Guild of Florists</u><sup>2</sup> and, of course, the Mapmakers' Guild.</p>
<p>But the historical import of the Venerable Society of Cartographers lies, not in the maps they drew of the world—though these were certainly important, and many have survived into the present day—but in the ways they began altering the world to fit their maps.  If memory serves, the initial precedent for this surprising course of action originated with Guildmaster Yithros the Exact, who modern scholars think likely suffered from some kind of obsessive-compulsive disorder.  As the story goes, Yithros was commissioned by the king of Thegul to produce a map of his country for their centennial, which Yithros did with characteristic exactitude.  However, someone jostled his writing arm while he was finishing the curve of the coast.  Such an error was unacceptable to him, so he journeyed out to Thegul and began shoveling away at the coast in order to make it fit his map.  Thegul, however, was entirely below sea level, relying on a complicated system of dykes to keep the ocean out.  Yithros's <i>a posteriori</i> correction flooded the entire country.  And so, the Guild histories tell us, Yithros travelled back to the Guild and changed his map to read "Thegul<i>f of Tan</i>."</p>
<p>Yithros's successors took increasing liberties with their maps.  Where before the Guild's mission had been purely descriptive, prescriptivist mapmaking began, inch by inch, to creep into their business model.  Naturally this was a concern for many Sovereigns, such as when <u>Lepazzia</u><sup>3</sup> ordered a map of the <u>Fractured Cities</u><sup>4</sup> with most of the territory covered by a compass rose.  To keep up with the increasingly geopolitical nature of their duties, the Venerable Cartographers began militarizing themselves to a level that would allow them to challenge nation-states.  The training and materiel required are, of course, a tremendous expenditure, and thus the Venerable Cartographers have abandoned mapmaking over the past few centuries, essentially becoming a top-tier paramilitary organization.</p>

<p></p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>The Very Definitely Independent States</h2><p><b>The Very Definitely Independent States</b> are the most visible embarrassment to the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns' global mandate. After the admittance of <u>the Hegemony of Whales</u><sup>1</sup> into the Assembly revealed a thousand-year-old loophole in the charter that gave the Hegemony a third of the votes in the Assembly, the former Union of Benric States, the country that covered the entire continent of Benri, was suddenly plunged into the Benric Civil War &mdash; named so not because it was a war within a single state, but because it was civil: there were zero deaths and only twenty injured across the entire continent, and none of them were combat injuries. After this sham of a civil war, half of the federal government of the UBS "collapsed" (read: retired with severance pay), and each of the constituent states' governors applied for admittance into the Assembly, insistent on their independence from each other. The other half of the federal government rebranded itself as the Camaraderie Committee of Benri and took the official stance that it was an <i>inter</i>national orgnaization dedicated to advising the newly formed and very definitely independent states of Benri. The first "non-binding recommendation" of the Committee to the Independent States &mdash; which was accepted without question by every State &mdash; was the creation of <u>the Yggdrasil Project</u><sup>2</sup>, ensuring the support of the ascendant Hegemony.</p></div>
<p>To the credit of the Very Definitely Independent States, the States do not always vote in accordance with the Committee's "recommendations", and these differences are even sometimes plausibly because of the differing interests of the States. But these VDIS splits are seemingly always proportioned to the degree of support the Committee has for a measure. Whenever the Committee has no recommendation or recommends abstention, the States somehow manage to always end up splitting their votes 50-50.</p>
<p>This state of affairs is tolerated by the rest of the Assembly, but at a diplomatic cost to the VDIS; generally, the States find it hard to advance their common interests in the Assembly beyond the immediate power they have as a voting bloc, and consequently they remain closely allied to the Hegemony to safeguard their international (and Assembly-procedural) interests. The limits of this tolerance were tested in 961, when Illithor claimed that the <u>Don't Think I Won't Act</u><sup>3</sup> had caused a civil war and it had to split into three independent countries. On the suggestion of the Flandrean <u>General "Ripper" Gorson</u><sup>4</sup>, The Assembly, minus the Hegemony, unanimously voted to send an occupying force to restore peace to the war-torn nation. The governor of Illithor then immediately announced that a legal team had solved the problem and ended the civil war. Occasionally, a sovereign will motion to have international forces unify some of the Independent States, but the States involved invariably claim that an ethnic war has just broken out and reunification is inadvisable.</p>

Most of the world had a chance to experience this in AES 688, when Selestei waged the <b>War of Durun's Ass</b>. During the first session of the year of the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns, President Durun of <u>The Union of Benric States</u><sup>2</sup> spilled his eggnog on King Gristleton of Selestei. Gristleton became enraged and told Durun that he was going to "kick [his] ass". Durun responded that he had a busy schedule, but that if he wanted to come to Benri in the summer and kick his ass then, he was welcome to visit. Gristleton ominously accepted the offer and left to the bathroom to wipe the eggnog off. After he had left, everyone in the room simultaneously realized what was about to happen. When Gristleton failed to return to the Assembly at the end of the recess, everyone between Selestei and the Union scrambled to contact their defense ministries, which was pretty much all of them, because Selestei and Benri are on opposite sides of the planet.</p></div>
<p>Selestei marched into <u>the Fractured Cities</u><sup>3</sup> at the beginning of the following week, fully armed and angry. For one of the only times in recorded history, in the face of the foreign threat on their borders, the Fractured Cities banded together as one to defend their homeland. They were immediately crushed by the Selesteine army. Pausing only long enough to arm-wrestle the survivors and carry off food and barrels of beer, the invading force simply marched straight through to the Shastrian border. In the face of the foreign threat on <i>their</i> borders, <u>Shaster</u><sup>4</sup> rallied its forces to defend its homeland. They, too, were immediately crushed by the Selesteine army. Seizing all of the ships in the harbor, the rampaging mob set sail for Benri &mdash; in the wrong direction. It would take travelling several months and conquering many more countries, including every single country on <u>the Careless Continent</u><sup>5</sup>, before Selestei stood upon the beaches of Benri.</p>
<p>Durun, of course, had heard of Selestei's path of devastation on the way to meet him, and was terrified. His advisers, fearing for the worst should the Selesteines beat a roundabout trail of mayhem on their way to the capital, kidnapped Durun and delivered him to King Gristleton the following day. When the two sovereigns finally stood face to face once again, Gristleton pointed out that Durun had invited him there, and then promptly, in the words of the contemporary historian <u>Pentex Lannogaster</u><sup>6</sup>, "beat the shit out of him". The Selesteines then returned home, and at the following Assembly session King Gristleton acted like the whole thing had never happened.</p>
<p>President Durun would later blame this all on Gristleton, who, he insisted, had bumped his arm when he was holding the eggnog.</p>

This would prove to be one of the formative moments for the young country, forcing them to band closer together for mutual aid to prevent a catastrophe of the same magnitude from reoccurring.

You can tell he's clearly never been out there, because that description is so fucking wrong—well, okay, technically all those things happen but <i>that's not the fucking point</i>, okay?  If you wanna know what windstriding is, go catch a ride on the next Ulgrav ship that resupplies in your area, find one of the tourist-friendly companies, and go punch the clouds with your face.  Pick <u>Yasser's Yells</u><sup>2</sup> if you can.  Ask for Ricardo.  Tell him I sent you.  I get a coupon for every new person I refer.  The <u>Secretary of the DAS</u><sup>3</sup> even recommends it!</p></div>
<p>Again, you're not really going to get it unless you're just <i>out there</i> freezing your ass off and having the time of your life.  But I'll try to translate it for you ground-bound dunderheads.  First of all, you have to realize that the sky has always been important to the Ulgravians.  Ancient Ulgrav was less a state than the territory of several nomadic warrior tribes.  The plains were our home, and we liked the sky because it was a lot like the plains but with fewer enemies.  "Cloud" in Ulgravian is literally translated "Rising dust from the hooves of warrior mounts," and that might seem like a mouthful but in Ulgrav there's a single word for it.  Long story short, when we packed up and left because of <u>those passive-aggressive snot-worms</u><sup>4</sup>, there was only one place we could go that was true to our roots: up.</p>
<p>Second thing, there's an old Ulgravian sport where you'd take an enemy's shield (unless you'd just fought the <u>Grim Weepers</u><sup>5</sup>, who never used shields, in which case you'd use one of their broadswords instead), tie it to your horse, and then let it gallop off.  You'd be standing on the shield (or sword), of course, so you'd have to pull yourself up the rope onto your galloping horse.  Good clean family fun, except all those times when people slipped and dashed their head open on a passing rock or something.  Whatever, it was harder to traumatize kids back then.  Anyways, you're a warrior tribe with a horse-based sport and you don't have horses but you <i>do</i> have one sweet-ass zeppelin, so what do you do?  Obviously, tie the shield to the airship and then jump off and let the airship gallop.</p>
<p>Then, after everyone who tried it that way plummeted to their deaths, they adapted it so that the rope was tied to the <i>person</i>.  Some groups'll still do it with the shield, and there's a subfaction that claims windstriding is all about surfing the shield on the air currents.  Don't listen to them, they're goatfuckers with no sense of history and none of their children will survive the winter.</p>

<p></p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>X-treme lecturing</h2><p>The pedagogical technique known as <b>X-treme lecturing</b> was an experimental teaching method pioneered by the infamous <u>Marvin Fitch</u><sup>1</sup>. Taking inspiration from research into memory recall during times of crisis, Fitch subjected his students to a continuous series of crises while he lectured. These crises, chosen to induce fight-or-flight responses, included such educational experiences as filling the room with Barcuvian carnivorous rage-hamsters, dropping the floor from the lecture hall and suspending the desks from oiled ropes, and assigning students to do group work with a <u>marionette child</u><sup>2</sup>. Students who performed poorly in Fitch's classes were especially subjected to this, since the theory of X-treme lecturing dictated that their performance would improve if they were subjected to even more stressful crises. Because these students were predictably picked off by this "attention", Fitch's methods went unnoticed or ignored by university administrators, who only saw Fitch's high rates of student success: an artifact of the bottom half of the bell curve falling off, so to speak.</p></div>
<p>X-treme lecturing was incidentally outlawed in AES 960 by the passing of <u>the I'll Legislate It, I Swear, Don't Think I Won't Act</u><sup>3</sup>, due to a clause that banned pedagogy involving hyphens. This, of course, was no obstacle to the indomitable Marvin Fitch, who switched careers to adult trade education. His practice of this technique continued and was taken up by disciples, which is generally agreed by sociologists to be the cause of the cold, dead, hollow thousand-yard stare electricians and plumbers tend to have in their eyes these days.</p>
<p>Despite its comparably low survival rate compared to most other pedagogical methods, X-treme lecturing boasts an impressive resume of alumni. Several seated members of the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns took at least one X-treme class with Fitch. The bond these alumni share is one stronger than any familial or institutional ties: the bond of shared trauma. One need only witness the knowing look that passes between two graduates of Fitch's in between the spasmodic twitching to know that something was understood there that the rest of us, for better or for worse, will never have access.</p>
<p>Conspiracy theorists regularly claim that Fitch's methods have been adopted by this or that government, or by the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns itself, as a means of re-educating political prisoners. These claims are rarely taken seriously, as Fitch has personally denied that X-treme 
lecturing is useful for education.</p>

At first, the raging, perpetual storm around the pole, known to sailors as the Vulterstrom, prevented any voyages close to the geographical pole, and in the <u>Mapmakers' Guild's</u><sup>1</sup> first map of the whole world the south was simply drawn in as impassible. The landmass in the center of the storm would not be discovered until <u>two centuries later</u><sup>2</sup>, when Selestei decided to sail straight through the Vulterstrom instead of going around. When a research expedition finally made it, it discovered strange and exotic ruins. At first, the ruins were simply blamed on Kingsland, but soon enough this explanation fell out of favor as the few monstrosities of Kingsland that ranged beyond the city were ruled out as possible explanations. The ruins were thereafter considered to be most likely of alien origin.</p></div>
<p>The prospect of studying these ruins soon led to talk of establishing a permanent base for research. The Vulterbase was nominally created in the mid-eighth century, though it wouldn't be for another century until the base saw real activity. Unfortunately, this was right around the time that the first <u>Dark Pentad</u><sup>3</sup> disciplines were being recognized. A few institutions decided to punish their newly-minted Pentad scholars by assigning them to the Vulterbase, which, because of the base's limited population, led to it becoming one of the densest concentrations of Pentad degrees in the world. In the chaos of the <u>Goats on Boats Affair</u><sup>4</sup> in 891, the Vulterbase's discontents revolted and declared themselves independent from the academic community. Attempts were made, first diplomatically and then <u>militarily</u><sup>5</sup>, to reconcile the Vulterbase to the academy, but all such attempts were repelled by the alien technology they had developed based on their research. When the dock became infested by <u>Ravenous Squid-Trees</u><sup>6</sup> in 939, the base was written off and the researchers left to their devices.</p>
<p>Enough records of the ruins themselves are available to the interested for their nature to remain a topic of interest. On the surface, there are multiple different buildings in a roughly symmetrical layout. Some of them rise two or three stories up, with one tower near the center going up several stories, but more interestingly, all of the buildings go deep below ground level, and the lower stories all connect to each other in a labyrinthine fashion. Explorers who have made it back out claim that the ruins keep going further down, with no lowest level having been found.</p>

On the night of the new moon, an eldritch green light can be seen shining from where the base is in the depths of the storm. The main hypothesis for this is that the rebels assembled something, either from leftover technology they had lying around, alien miscellanea scavenged from the ruins, or something they dredged up from a ship that sank trying to suppress them. Most think it's an energy reactor of some sort, since they wouldn't survive long without one, but nobody can explain what kind of reactor would produce that light. Moreover, the light is only faint at the long distance Panark observes from; at the base itself it must be incredibly bright. Less popular is the theory that it's a lighthouse of some sort. This theory is less popular because nobody <i>really</i> thinks the Vulterbase rebels care enough about the rest of the world to stop their ships from running aground. They'd probably welcome it, because they could scavenge the parts. There's also a fringe theorist who keeps ranting about "<u>chromatic aberration</u><sup>3</sup> this" and "sociophysical effects that", but Dr. Christophy gets annoyed when you call him a fringe theorist.</p>

<p>1. Yasser's Yells</p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>Yasser's Yells</h2><p>Let me begin by saying that I am still not entirely sure why we have an article about <b>Yasser's Yells</b> in this report.  Dr. Hanson assured me that one was necessary, however, and since this is in fact the Butterfly Effect Advisory Committee, there is truly no telling what information might turn out to be important in the future.</p></div>
<p>Allow me some minor pontification, if you would, while we're on that point.  The function of a Butterfly Effect Advisory Committee is to guard against so-called "dark horse" outcomes—that is, outcomes not seriously considered when preparing for the future.  If a body, like our own august Assembly, fails to consider a 1% chance of catastrophic failure, then should that slim thread of possibility come to pass, it will do so without any safeguards.  I like to think that the function of this Committee is to remain but a minor footnote in the workings of the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns and ensure that nothing ever comes to pass that would cause us to rise into prominence.  Ours is vital work.</p>
<p>With all of that said, I cannot possibly imagine what dark horse global catastrophe might arise from an independently-owned recreational <u>windstriding</u><sup>1</sup> company on the fringe of the <u>Ulgravian</u><sup>2</sup> zeppelin fleet.  Still, as mentioned above, Dr. Hanson told me she knows the owner and thinks it's a necessary addition to this report.  A good Chairman trusts in the ability of those under his wing, of course, and so I set out to do my due diligence.</p>
<p>After doing my research, I must conclude that it seems like there could very well be something going on with Yasser's Yells.  For example, I heard <u>Secretary</u><sup>3</sup> recommend it while she was standing in our break room.  Why, one wonders, would the Secretary of the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns know of a small company in a nation she's only visited twice?  Suspicious alignments of that sort always suggest a <u>likely candidate</u><sup>4</sup>, but when I reached out through the usual channels I couldn't find any evidence of botanical business dealings whatsoever.  My next thought was that the <u>Botherhood</u><sup>5</sup> might be involved—which hypothesis is the most probable to my mind, given that when the appropriate contacts investigated, they told me that it was as if the Botherhood had never meddled in Yasser's Yells whatsoever!</p>
<p>In the interest of full disclosure, I intend to patronize this establishment after the report ships out.  Dr. Hanson's reviews were quite favorable, and there is still some life in these old bones yet!</p>

<p></p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>The Yggdrasil Project</h2><p>The <b>Yggdrasil Project</b> was an ambitious biotechnical research project spearheaded by an international collaboration between the <u>Very Definitely Independent States</u><sup>1</sup>, the <u>Hegemony of Whales</u><sup>2</sup>, and <u>Shaster</u><sup>3</sup>.  The project began life as an idle side project of <u>the inimitable Dr. Stafford</u><sup>4</sup> during a guest teaching stint at the <u>National Academy of Velskyavo</u><sup>5</sup>, which goes a ways toward explaining the project's success in the face of Shastrian involvement.</p></div>
<p>The basic idea of the project was to create a new form of life that could cleanse the oceans of centuries of industrial pollution.  Dr. Stafford's notes suggested taking advantage of the distinctive properties of the oceanic environment; thus, it was decided some kind of plant would work best.  The final shape of the organism evolved over the course of the project; while it was initially modeled after kelp, the nascent Yggdrasil organism soon began to take after terrestrial trees in shape.</p>
<p>It is appropriate at this point to note that the various participants had different objectives for the project.  Shaster's motives, as ever where Dr. Stafford is concerned, are entirely transparent: they've never missed a chance to be involved with one of his projects.  As such, their involvement was mostly nominal.  The Very Definitely Independent States, on the other hand, had more than the glory of a Stafford project at stake: a successful collaboration with the Hegemony would cement their position on the international stage.  But that motivator proved to be the project's undoing.</p>
<p>As the project progressed, the Hegemony of Whales began to push for an additional project goal: the ability to control Hegemony territory.  <u>Flandre</u><sup>6</sup> had always been a thorn in the Hegemony's side, especially given their flaunting the recently instituted Whale Tariffs, and of course they'd never been on the best of terms with the <u>Panark Fleet</u><sup>7</sup>.  To appease the cetacean pressure, the other actors on the project quickly moved to appease them.  Thus, in addition to filtering out toxins from the water, the organism was also given prehensile tentacles strong enough to drag a boat below the surface.</p>
<p>After years of development, the Yggdrasil Project was declared complete in 939, after which they hired the <u>Esoteric Order of Florists</u><sup>8</sup> to plant them all over the world.  But no sooner had Hegemon Aouwouou unveiled the first fully-grown forest of <u>Ravenous Squid-Trees</u><sup>9</sup> on live television did they seize and devour her before disbelieving witnesses.  Reeling in shock, the Hegemony did the only thing they could, and blamed Flandre.</p>

Every time I drop an expletive on this genius, the words come out all cheerfully sycophantic.  <i>God</i>, this is gonna firebomb my reputation.</p></div>
<p>So let's go back to 908.  Pretend you're a twenty-year-old <u>Flandrean</u><sup>2</sup> hyper-genius and you've just finished inventing <u>asynchronous energy theory</u><sup>3</sup>.  The math works out, but accounting for <u>Barcuvian antiweather</u><sup>4</sup> makes it hideously complicated and no one but you can understand it.  Your own government's too cautious to mess with it and if you give free energy to <u>the Double-North Pole</u><sup>5</sup>, you're committing treason.  Meanwhile, the rest of the academy isn't recognizing any of your achievements, despite the fact that they're objectively brilliant.</p>
<p>So what did the matchless Dr. Stafford do?  He took a trip up north—well, technically he went through the dead zone east of Barcu, which really makes you question how smart it is to live there when the greatest mind of our age made a point of never setting foot inside—and met with <u>Klaus Santanna</u><sup>6</sup>.  This witty prodigy gets <i>fucking Santanna</i> to trade the secrets of mind control for a free energy deal, conditional on Flandre getting a head start.  Dr. Stafford spent a year up north (unusual for one of his projects), publishes a bunch of papers no one understands, and then heads back home to work on a new device: the <b>Zeitgeist Manipulator</b>.</p>
<p>Intellectual paragon Dr. Stafford <i>shit fuck dammit</i> published a paper on how the thing works.  Here's the problem, though.  The Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns isn't necessarily where the smartest academics congregate, but it <i>is</i> where the academics with the best connections congregate, and neither I nor <i>anyone I know</i> can even figure out <i>who to ask to decipher this masterpiece</i>.  For example, the brilliant doctor <i>dammit</i> is recorded as saying <u>mad law</u><sup>7</sup> factors in somehow, and no one can even begin to figure out <i>where</i>.</p>
<p>What the Zeitgeist Manipulator does, however, is encourage everyone to accept the worthiness of the targeted individual don't fucking listen to me it's a fucking mind control (well, okay, that's a bit of an overstatement) <i>FUCK THIS SHIT</i>.</p>
<p>Once the machine was constructed, everyone worldwide starting having these intrusive thoughts about the clever Dr. Stafford, which came as a shock to most of them because they'd never heard of him before.  (<u>Shaster</u><sup>8</sup> in particular reported very high rates of this).  But eventually Dr. Stafford's well-deserved fame grew, finally convincing Flandre to create infrastructure for asynchronous energy.</p>
<p>Flandre, of course, recognized the incredible potential of the Zeitgeist Manipulator to update many of their National Response Protocols (e.g. <u>BX-392a</u><sup>9</sup> could be replaced by a modified Manipulator that targets snake brains).  Unfortunately for them, the ongoing effects of the Manipulator meant that none of their agents were able to take act against the peerless Dr. Stafford, and he launched the Manipulator into space on an <i>ad hoc</i> rocket.</p>

But you don't care about that.  You're reading this article to find out why there's a giant fucking smiley face in the night sky, leering at you and scaring the snotty little bipedal consumerism batteries you call children.</p></div>
<p>First off, <u>researchers</u><sup>1</sup> are pretty sure that the moon didn't start out that way.  (Like, duh, it's a fucking ball of rock.  Smiley faces aren't natural fucking phenomena.)  The historical record puts it as one of the main inciting events for the <u>Roerbach Incident</u><sup>2</sup>.  So really the big puzzle is how it got that way.  How'd someone fuck up a moon eight hundred years before anyone made it to space?</p>
<p>Well, there's an easy answer and a hard answer.  The easy answer is we don't really know <i>how</i> it was done, so we probably don't have to worry about the same thing happening to one of the other moons, or to the planet.  Besides, it's been a long time, so we're probably done with that sort of thing happening again, right?  Yeah, well, <i>easy answers are for cowards</i>.</p>
<p>The hard answer is that we do know <i>why</i> it happened: fucking <u>Kingsland</u><sup>3</sup>.  ("We" here excludes the whole lot of <u>tumor-brained sea cows</u><sup>4</sup> who blame <u>Flandre</u><sup>5</sup>.)  Shoulda been obvious in hindsight, really.  Like, their whole fucking shtick is "oh no, the stars are right, we're all doomed!"  And I get that y'all wanna just laugh the whole thing off, cuz when has an ancient Kingslander deity ever shown up and fucked up <i>your</i> front lawn?  </p>
<p>Well, it happened.  Apparently some kinda eldritch thingy showed up and they managed to seal it in the moon.  That's what caused the giant smily cracks.  It also <u>fucked up the ocean</u><sup>6</sup> despite the fact that <u>tides don't work that way</u><sup>7</sup>.</p>
<p>So here's the thing—your dismissive, I-don't-wanna-worry-about-this-because-it-distracts-me-from-watching-television attitude is <i>ridiculously</i> stupid, because every night the tentacle-prints of some unspeakable horror play voyeur on your pathetic excuse for a sex life.  Just in case you weren't paying attention, we've got ancient Kingslander records saying the holes in the third moon happened because <i>the stars were right for once</i>.  Like, you wanna talk about butterfly effects?  What do you do when the butterfly is some eleventh-dimensional thing that can't eat us because the continents happen to be aligned in the right way?  <i>What the fuck do you think happens when you move them around</i>?</p>

She was demerited with a Doctorate of Misosophy for her achievements in the egregious violation of scholarly norms and remorseless sabotage of her academic opponents, and subsequently recognized by her peers as a dangerous and unhinged maverick when she actually showed up to her misosophy degree conferral. Her work in the field of combat philosophy has been denounced by several major journals of philosophy, and she has the prestigious honor of being the first Pentad academic to receive a restraining order from an official conference of the Notional Academy of Barcu. Her appointment to the Butterfly Effect Advisory Committee passed by a 3 vote margin and provoked an official letter of protest from the High Exarch Minor of Flandre.</i></p></div>
<p><i>Dr. Rubric enjoys fencing, mountain biking, and the panicked consternation of freshmen.

Sixty years and seven academic positions later, he has not lost that early enthusiasm for rearranging humanity's knowledge into shapes that suit us better.</i></p></div>
<p><i>Dr. Jones is a prolific author, having published over thirty volumes of nonfiction, including </i>Where to Put the Shit<i>—an exhaustive treatise on how architects place restrooms when designing buildings—as well as the celebrated trilogy </i>Venereal Diseases of the Great Historians, Vol. I-III.<i>  He also made history by publishing the first fully fictional encyclopedia, </i>The Fairfax Guide to Other Places,<i> which won the Greentemple Award for Creative Fiction in AS 973.</i></p>
<p><i>Dr. Jones's career has been marked by academic success in addition to literary.  After winning a Staff of Mastery from the Yuglandian College of Hysteria's Inventory Department, he pursued a doctorate education at the University of Eyesland.  There he studied Miscellania under the legendary Riggs Behemon, who remained a close friend and mentor until his death in AS 982.  Dr. Jones's doctorate thesis was adapted into the </i>Herbert Jones Encyclopedia of Precarious Legislation.  <i>Dr. Jones would later return to the University of Eyesland to claim the Heinrich Stafford Chair of Arrangement.</i></p>
<p><i>A noted expert in politics, Dr. Jones was chosen to preside over the Butterfly Effect Advisory Committee for the Disarrangement Act in AS 989.</i></p>

She received a Masters degree (with honors) from the University of Hejilad, and completed her doctorate work with the Townsend Foundation with a groundbreaking thesis on why the Botherhood can't possibly get anything done.</i></p></div>
<p><i>Entropology had long been something of a niche academic field until Dr. Hanson brought it into prominence with the popular nonfiction book "Why Everything Goes to Shit" in AS 986.  The work introduced an entry-level understanding of entropology to the general populace, which seemed like a good thing until it, inevitably, went to shit.  Now she can't walk down the street without hearing morons butchering her life's work in casual conversations.  Fuck all of you.</i></p>
<p><i>As an academic and professor, Dr. Hanson has won the respect of both colleagues and students.  She was awarded the Ngote Award for Professorial Excellence in AS 988, a highly coveted decoration given to a professor by majority student vote.  She has successfully defended against no less than four accusations of misosophy, even managing to reflect the humiliation on her accuser in three of those cases.</i></p>

<p><i>In AS 983, Honored Milton won acclaim by uncovering the secret insider-only fast-track inside the m-soc program at Stafford College and blackmailing the administration into giving him his degree after only three weeks.  Over the next three months, he successfully negotiated Masters degrees from Kains University and the Royal University of Lepazzia simultaneously, before following up with a PhD from Warbaum's University before the end of the year.  This rise in prominence beat the fastest record for m-soc career path completion, so by the following year the Grand Council of Memetosociologists had awarded him the right to use the honorific above PhD: MHO, or "Most Honored One."</i></p>
<p><i>In recognition of his academic and social engineering achievements, Honored Milton invited himself to the Butterfly Effect Advisory Committee and joined in AS 987.</i></p>

His seminal work </i>The King Electric: The Influence of Electromagnetic Variance on Order and Revolution<i> is widely considered by sociologists and physicists. He achieved international renown during his presidency over the 988 Butterfly Effect Advisory Committee that advised the Disputatious Assembly of Sovereigns on the civil unrest in Flandre following the death of the High Exarch. His knack for applying the systems analysis of physical science to the social dynamics of succession came to the fore during the Committee's debate over whether to recommend the annihilation of </i>both<i> sides of the conflict.

<p></p><div style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><h2>🔇</h2><p>The enigmatic phenomenon designated in print as "🔇", and designated in speech by pausing and gesturing emphatically, is difficult to describe. This is not for lack of trying, as several major universities have faculty who attempt to publish work on it. "Attempt" is the key word here, as all direct descriptions of it are suppressed by forces not currently understood. Despite the fact that it is not, as researchers suspect, a meteorological phenomenon, the most success on studying 🔇 has come from Barcuvian weather analysts. While the flashes of complete darkness and resounding silences of <u>antithunderstorms</u><sup>1</sup> are clearly similar to 🔇, the exact relationship they have has yet to be articulated, for obvious reasons. Despite this seemingly inherent barrier to results, research into it continues to be funded, undoubtedly helped by the inability of university administrators to say what exactly it is they are trying to cut out of the research budget.</p></div>
<p>For what are hopefully equally obvious reasons, this phenomenon is the subject of a great deal of interest from the Kingsland cult of <u>Silentus, the patron deity of some goddamn peace and quiet for once</u><sup>2</sup>. By engaging in a campaign of linguistic activism, the cult has succeeded in hijacking a number of common local idioms to connote or otherwise reference it. Consequently, conversations in which these idioms are used are liable to be suddenly halted by the suppression effect. This has led to widespread sentiment against the cult of Silentus, which, in a grand irony, has led to them being bothered by people making ruckuses more than they were before. The cult, as usual, has yet to make an official statement about this, but it is unclear whether this is because of its patron deity or because being accosted by mutes for linguistic subversion is far from the worst thing that could happen to you in Kingsland.</p>
<p>The motivation to understand 🔇 in the academic community is largely driven by engineers working in the field of <u>symphonic warp traversal</u><sup>3</sup>. The field has yet to fully understand the technology that the mad inventor Rime Grimes left behind, which enabled complex warp calculations to be performed via orchestra, and thus money is thrown at any lead on an ontological link between acoustics and other subfields of physics. This has somewhat tarnished the prestige of warp research in the public eye, as physics departments specializing in warp research find themselves unable to describe where their budget goes.</p>
<p>What is truly remarkable, however, is the significance 🔇 holds for the Disarrangement Act. Because it</p>
