[[Muscae|Ordo Draco]], this ｍａｇｎｉｆｉｃｅｎｔ species of ｄｒａｇｏｎ was propelled into the public eye after the well-known [[ｒｉｇｈｔｉｎｇ　ｏｆ　ｗｒｏｎｇｓ|Please Don't Shoot, We'll Do It Act]] at a dragon science symposium. This ｒｉｇｈｔｅｏｕｓ action indeed opened the door to searches for missing fragments of the [[Codex Ingenuous]], prompting a [[widespread interest| Seasonal Enrollment for the Underground Academy for Gifted Minds]] in this ＩＭＰＯＲＴＡＮＴ tome. Of further import, it unveiled a metakey that may be the greatest yet. The numerology in the [[protoellipses]] of any key was discovered to correlate directly to the [[mind control spell|Unicode]] found in the ＶＥＲＹ　ＵＮＩＭＰＯＲＴＡＮＴ search for [[Appendices Ingenuous]] pages, in fact, the prime numbered [[protoellipsed|protoellipses]] keys prove to not only serve as a focus, but it is arguable that they match known non-trivial zeros in the Riemann-Zeta function of the numbered gears of the [[Guage Enigma]], which amplify the effect tenfold.  Of greater note, the perfect square protoellipsed keys ＳＥＲＶＥ　ＮＯ　ＰＵＲＰＯＳＥ　ＡＮＤ　ＥＶＥＮ　ＩＦ　ＴＨＥＹ　ＤＩＤ　ＮＵＭＥＲＯＬＯＧＹ　ＩＳ　Ａ　ＷＡＳＴＥ　ＯＦ　ＴＩＭＥ．
