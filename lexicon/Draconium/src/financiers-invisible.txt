[1] Okay, I think we're safe here. For some reason, the taxmen can't read footnotes. The **Financiers Invisible ** are a secret society of beings whose original forms are unknown. A freak [[Literarosphere]] accident resulted in their physically visible forms being erased, but they remain with us in the form of ghostly psychic revenants, forever wailing about incentive taxes and departmental audits.

[2] Since they're invisible, it is difficult to evaluate the innumerable claims that the Financiers are responsible for this or that historical event. Such claims are usually dismissed as just-so stories, but some have gained minor traction among dracohistorians. The most well-supported of these is the recent theory that the Financiers funded the [[Great Merchant|Hans, the Great Merchant of Dragons and Men]], explaining how he was able to make such risky business ventures.

[3] There are few records of attempted resistance against the Financiers, but no records of a Financier ever being killed. This has led to a variety of folk tales about their resilience, most popularly that only the way to kill one is the intense flame of a [[Loong]] held by a pure maiden.

[4] We don't thank him for the warning that we're next, as long as Pulluman doesn't [[open the damn window again|Please Don't Shoot, We'll Do It Act]]. Ilron, did you buy those padlocks yet?
