**Is your teen “rhellgazing?” Know the risks!**

Has your teen come home after curfew with darkened eye-pits or a scaly 
hide? If so, he or she may have fallen prey to the latest teenage craze: 
“rhellgazing”.

“Rhellgazing” involves staring directly at the blindingly iridescent 
walls of the [[Meteoric Temple]] from afar, often for extended periods 
of time. While unsubstantiated by the [[Codex Ingenuous]], legend 
maintains that the practice owes its beginnings to [[Kelorna the Extremely Confused]], who began “rhellgazing” late in her life. The 
inspiration for the name, or what the “Rhell” could be, is completely 
unknown to modern dragon science. 

Perplexingly, participants are typically unable to describe the 
experience, but are drawn to repeat it, and typically gain a fanatical 
interest in the dragon sciences. Usually, this fascination occurs at the 
expense of their mental faculties and personal identities.

Telltale signs that your teen has been “rhellgazing” include:\\
* Acne\\
* Defiant behavior\\
* Becoming a pillar of ash\\
* [[Ｓｐｅａｋｉｎｇ ｉｎ ｕｎｉｃｏｄｅ| Unicode]]

Just as real as the risks of “rhellgazing” are its associations: the 
practice is a rite of passage for several organized crime rings, 
particularly those involved in the odious crime of fire-fighting.

Parents suspecting their teens of “rhellgazing” should attempt to ignite 
them – resistance to total incineration is a certain indicator of their 
participation in this troubling fad.
