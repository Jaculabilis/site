# Title: Yellow wyrmidon

One of the most famous case studies in dragon conservation is that of the **yellow wyrmidon**. While its cousin, the black wyrmidon, is still extant across most of the [[Scorialic Sea]], the yellow wyrmidon is now extinct. The yellow-skinned black wyrmidon is hunted at a sustainable rate, since its black licorice taste has only a small but ardent following -- as evident from the mere two entries in Pulluman's //Ninety Unexpected Recipes for Dragonflesh// that make use of it, and in relatively small quantities. On the other hand, the black-skinned yellow wyrmidon features in fourteen entries in the same book. Once [[Dr. Gumphry|Talonstain]] amended the Underground Academy budget and reallocated the mathematics department's funding to [[her confection side business|The Beautiful Cupcakes of Dr. Ophelia Gumphry from the Underground Academy for Gifted Minds]] on [[Pulluman's|Talonstain]] insistence, the increased demand wiped the yellow wyrmidon out. (She has since had to switch to using [[chidl|Childarn]] meat, which explains why the quality has nosedived as of late.)

The lessons learned from the yellow wyrmidon extinction have since galvanized dragon conservationists to push for legislation protecting [[turtledragons]], which are no longer, whether or not they were before, endangered. This was accomplished largely via mass emailing. These methods have [[drawn criticism|Ontological cost]], but mostly from people who caused the problem in the first place, so they probably deserved it. On an unrelated note, attached are the email addresses of all the faculty members of the Underground Academy for Gifted Minds.
