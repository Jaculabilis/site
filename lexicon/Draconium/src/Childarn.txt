It is frightening the extents to which dragon science will go. The Childarn population was conceived in a glass tube (hence their [[low quality|Yellow wyrmidon]] of meat). Their intelligence is unparalleled, and after escaping, due in part to [[muscae uprising|Please Don't Shoot, We'll Do It Act]], they became relatively integrated into society. There have been attempts to study them, but the lifespan of a Childarn researcher is significantly shorter than most.

Of greater interest is the psychical elements of the Childarn. Their teeth are used in the construction of [[protoellipses]], and it can be no accident that Childarn have varying amounts of teeth per each individual, but all have a prime number amount, which must be related to the consequent power of prime numbered protoellipsed keys. And here we have arrived at yet another metakey.

If we are able to unlock the relationship between the Childarn, their [[diet|Surf and Turf]], their prime numbered teeth, and ellipses, it may in fact be enough to unlock the Guage, or at least begin production of keys again. Only a perfect square amount of time will tell.
