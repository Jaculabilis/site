# Title: Haiku of Keysmith Xemoniphon the Elder

Arguably the most beautiful of anything produced by the [[Third Dynasty of Meteora]] (aside from the keys produced obviously), this haiku, crafted by famed keysmith, architect, poet, philosopher, and baker [[Xemoniphon the Elder]], is a metakey to the Guage Enigma. Understanding this enables understanding of the keys, and much like a key, this lovely poem demands understanding, patience, and above all, time.

//Forge the seven keys//

//One by four by one by one//

//Unlock the one Guage//

Notice how intricate the numerology winds throughout the poem. Seven keys, followed by seven syllables. The first perfect square number followed by the second, followed by two perfect squares. Scholars have pondered how the pattern would have continued had the poem been in different form (perhaps this question forms yet another metakey). 

In any case, Xemoniphon produced this shortly before the fourth set of one hundred keys were produced, and it is an undisputed fact that this haiku enabled Meteora to produce these keys with such swiftness and perfection, and is a vital component of the [[Codex Ingenuous]]. It is therefore of tantamount importance that we understand this metakey posthaste, without it even our discovery of new keys will be moot.
