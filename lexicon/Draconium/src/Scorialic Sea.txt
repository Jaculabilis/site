# Title: Scorialic Sea

A body of water with a most dire history, the Scorialic Sea is home to a number of dragon species,[1] and also boasts a remarkable geography consisting of both fertile and barren islands, ruined by both dragon fire and volcanoes. It is here that the [[Meteoric Temple]] is found, built at the mouth of the mighty [[Woken God|The Woken God]].

The Scorialic Sea boasts of nine islands of various sizes (notice the perfect square again, perhaps inspiring [[Xemoniphon the Elder]] in his crafting of both keys and poetry). One island is fertile, no volcanoes being found. One island has two volcanoes, whereas two islands have three apiece. The remaining five have dormant volcanoes, yet mysteriously their lands have not regrown yet, possibly due to their [[being the location|Ontological cost]] of the forging of the famous [[Key of Xemonides]].

The Vaticant maintained a strong hold in the sea and its surrounding lands. It wasnâ€™t until the end of the Third Meteoric Dynasty where the noble dracomonks attempted to forge [[unanimite]] keys without the proper metaphysics in place. A psychical backblast from the Loong destroyed most Vaticant presence, leaving only the [[Meteoric Temple]] standing. It is postulated that famed dracoscientist [[Kelorna|Kelorna the Extremely Confused]] first developed her extreme confusion due to this backblast, leading to her rise to fame, a rise only matched by her descent into actual confusion. It is due to her research at the Scorialic Sea that we have Keys 138 and 134 3/2, and so we key scientists owe both the psychic backblast and the esteemed scientist Kelorna a great debt of gratitude.
