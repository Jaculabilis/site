# Title: Thrognurith the Dragon Rider

The madman responsible for not only the horrific crime of the extermination of [[draconic families| Ordo Draco]] Conformata, Porca, and Sirena, but also of intellectual crimes including the destruction of all but a few fragments of the knowledge of this now extinct species, the theft of the [[Codex Ingenuous]], the theft and subsequent tearing asunder of the only known key whose [[protoellipses]] surpassed even those of the [[Key of Xemonides]]. He disappeared after a botched attempt at thievery at [[The Woken God]], foiled by not only the dracomonks, but also by the [[Great Merchant Hans|Hans, the Great Merchant of Dragons and Men]] and the well-known thief [[Petrine|Mean Petrine the Stealing Machine]] in the only recorded instance of them being publicly seen together. In an amusing turn of events, Thrognurith was run out with Muscae swarming over him, hence the now well-known name which, when lost in translation, leads one to believe that he rode dragons himself.
