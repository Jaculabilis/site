# Title: Lexicon Draconium

Dear Authors of the Lexicon,

I am **done** with you and your magazine! In your previous volume, you had the gall to publish a description of a [[streaming brainsplainer transtelecast|Brainsplainer]] in your "article" on the [[brainsplainer|Brainsplainer]]! Is there **anyone** on your editorial staff who understands the unsubstantiated and obviously existent addictive potential of these devices? Did **anyone** stop to think that a [[childarn|Childarn]] might pick up a "Lexicon" "Draconium" and read that disgusting article? I don't want to have to explain to a [[chidl|Childarn]] what a transtelecast is when I don't even know what they are!!

Maybe your recklessly irresponsible writers are too young to remember -- but when I grew up, I read the Codex Ingenuous **without** a brainsplainer, and that's reason enough for me to know that they must be **strictly dangerous** and **obviously unethical** -- just like sparking water, antibiotics, and plaid!

Could I have just stopped reading the Lexicon or skipped over that article? Yes, I could have, but it makes me angry that other people might read about a thing that makes me uncomfortable. I will not rest until you've indelibly removed **all** material that I could construe as threatening to my unspecified and likely inconsistent values from your **filthy** publication!!

I only want [[what's best for the childarn|Childarn]]! Shouldn't you?!

~ A CONCERNED MOTHER!!
