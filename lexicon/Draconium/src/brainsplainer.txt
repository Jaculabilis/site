Of all the wooly hoaxes that the so-called "academy" "elites" have pulled over the eyes of the public, no hoax is so wooly nor so far pulled as the **"brainsplainer"**. Touted by its snake-oil salesmen as a way to read [[protoellipses]] without succumbing to [["key madness"|Lexicon Draconium]], these //conspirators// (for that is the only word appropriate to the occasion) claim that the technology has antecedents in the [[Literarosphere]] of [[Kelorna the Extremely Confused]]. Tell me, when was the last time anything built by that madwoman worked? Hogwash, the lot of it. I've disassambled a brainsplainer, and I can't tell what anything inside it does.

These carnival hooligans haven't stopped at pushing their wares only on [[Guage Key|Guage Enigma]] researchers, either. The latest "studies" (ha! as if) claim that even reading the [[Codex|Codex Ingenuous]] should be done with a brainsplainer, due to proto-protoelliptic effects etched into the magmatic pages themselves. They //say// that the existence of these effects is a clue to uncovering the catastrophe that destroyed [[Ergniramniphoniclufiville]] -- but wouldn't that be just //so// convenient for these "researchers", who no doubt will take such a "result" as an opportunity to ask for more funding?

In reality, there is probably no such thing as protoelliptic psychic shock. It is a lie sold by dragonflesh butchers to hype up their wares, eaten up by consolation-prize dracoscientists to explain why their protoelliptic research projects keep falling through. News flash: not everyone can do dracoscience with the big boys. I've read every protosllipsis on [[Epiliton]] twice, and only had three nosebleeds -- and one of those was just because of the pain medication I was snorting. If there were such a thing as key madness, I would have it in spades, but I don't. Explain //that//, you third-rate //hacks//.

P.S. 'Twas I who stole that [[unanimite]] lunchbox from the office fridge, and no, I'm not giving it back. Ever since I've started using it as a helmet, the voices have gotten quieter. If you want it back, you'll have to pry it from my cold, oddly-vibrating hands.
