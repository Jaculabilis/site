# Title: Seasonal Enrollment for the Underground Academy for Gifted Minds

//In times of confusion and controversy, the Council of Bardslayers holds a contest to see 
which Bardslayer can best determine the facts of the matter.  This contest is one of the few 
opportunities for a Bardslayer to advance in rank.//

//In recognition of services rendered in the noble cause of fact-checking, the Council of 
Bardslayers hereby awards the //**//Order of the Mighty Pen//**// to contender //**//Yedevek Ilron//**// for 
this excellent Slaying.//

In light of recent events, it seems like a breath of sanity is in order.  I fear I will not 
be much help in bringing peace to the dead or consoling the living; my talents are better 
suited to enlightening the confused.  As such, I have answered the questions which have come 
up most frequently in the controversy surrounding Underground Academy's Enrollment Festival.

**Q: What is the Underground Academy for Gifted Minds?**

A: UAGM boasts of being the "highest ranked university" for Enigmatology.  While this claim 
is technically true, that is due to UAGM being located aboard a ship in orbit.  
However, UAGM still enjoys more favorable critical reviews than its competitors, which supporters 
claim is due to some combination of its [[relationship|Ｙｏｕ　ｆｏｏｌｓ　ｈａｖｅ　ｎｏ　ｉｄｅａ　ｗｈｏ　ｙｏｕ＇ｒｅ　ｍｅｓｓｉｎｇ　ｗｉｔｈ！　Ｐｒａｉｓｅ　ｂｅ　ｔｏ　ｔｈｅ　ＡＬＭＩＧＨＴＹ　ＭＵＳＣＡＥ！！！]] to the [[Please Don't Shoot, We'll Do It Act]], the presence 
of international superstar [[Gustivus Pulluman]] among its faculty, and privileged access 
to the largest portion of the [[Appendices Ingenuous]] known to exist in one place.

Anonymous critics of UAGM argue that the actual reason is that UAGM uses orbital bombardment 
to keep its competitors in check.  UAGM spokespeople have replied that it is easy to make 
anonymous accusations, and that if these critics really believed in what they were saying, 
they would reveal their name and address.

UAGM is also famous for its comprehensive code of ethics, which, among other things, forbids 
research on anyone but [[criminals|The Educational Exploitation of Dragon Fire]], while 
declaring it a crime to be a research subject.

**Q: What happened at the Enrollment Festival?**

A: [[Kelorna the Extremely Confused]], thought to have been rehabilitated, was revealed 
not to be rehabilitated.  She had enrolled as a student in the incoming class, and those 
close to her had reported that she seemed to have changed for the better.  However, during 
the traditional icebreaker and assassinate-off, there was a surprise showing by the 
[[muscae|Ordo Draco]], followed by what eyewitnesses describe as a triumphant shout from 
Kelorna, who then said:

//It worked!  By the gods, it worked!  They thought they could stop me with mere dragonfire, 
but they couldn't stop me from storing my consciousness in a dragon-shaped flock of 
[[telepathic|Unicode]] birds with flamethrowers!  Now the [[Codex|Codex Ingenuous]] shall 
be mine at last!  All has gone according to my design!//

Witnesses say that was when the engine compartment exploded.

**Q: Why did the engine compartment explode?**

A: Though there is still uncertainty regarding what, precisely, occurred, first responders report 
finding the body of some poor unfortunate occupying the same physical space as the main 
engines, [[Meklondiche]] clutched in one hand in a death grip.  When word spread that Meklondiche 
had shown up in the engine compartment, the resulting attentional shift is theorized to have 
collapsed the [[ontological indeterminacy|ontological cost]] and warped every third molecule 
out of the engine compartment and into an unknown dimension, resulting in the explosion that 
left UAGM in freefall.

It is likely that this was just a freak accident.  Meklondiche had recently been the subject 
of an extensive email chain, and to calculate this precise outcome would truly require an 
intellect more vast and terrifying than the Wheelmind's.  It is hard to imagine what 
[[grievance|The Beautiful Cupcakes of Dr. Ophelia Gumphry from the Underground Academy for Gifted Minds]] 
such an entity might have against UAGM.

**Q: Is Gustivus Pulluman okay?**

A: Yes, as soon as they finish replacing his other arm.

**Q: What happened to Kelorna?**

A: According to witnesses, after the explosion occurred, she attempted to access the Codex 
archives with her new student ID card, but was stopped by a woman eyewitnesses are referring 
to as "Kelorna's Good Twin."  It is unknown who she is or where she came from.  We only know 
that she was skilled enough at hand-to-hand combat to fight off a dragon-shaped swarm of birds 
by herself, and that after driving the villains away she vanished, pausing only to reclaim 
a [[unanimate|Unanimite]] lunchbox that UAGM professor Ersatz Scriver was 
[[using as a hat|Brainsplainer]] while muttering something about getting back into disguise.

Kelorna's whereabouts are currently unknown.  We can only hope that this mysterious protector 
is up to the task.

**Q: Did Atherton Guage set up these events as part of his eternal quest to thwart Kelorna?**

A: //Talonstains,// A CONCERNED, he's been dead for //centuries!// That's //completely improbable!//  
How many times do I have to tell you that chain letters don't count as peer review?  
Don't bring this up again until you have //actual evidence!//
