# Title: First Half Dynasty of Meteora

The First Half Dynasty of Meteora is known for it's groundbreaking studies on protoellipses and the ontology of their numbers. Many dracologists are known for their discoveries at this time, most noteably [[Atherton Guage]] for his Prime Number Protoellipses case study. Another //infamous// aspect of Atherton was his public suggestion for [[Kelornaâ€™s| Kelorna the Extremely Confused]] controversial therapy which led him to beat her in the political races of that time.

The First Half Dynasty is also known for it's development of the dracomonks. [[Meteoric Temple]] leaders scavenged the [[Scorialic Sea]] for pirates and then subsequently searched the lands surrounding the great [[Woken God|The Woken God]] for any homeless people with nothing better to do and they took all those people, gave them some flashy robes, changed their names to that of [[firetongue|Fireminds]], and made them the first true generation of dracomonks. 

Other Notable Successes of the First Half Dynasty:

*This is when it was first discovered that led piping was poisonous and hence it was all changed out (excluding the piping around all living enemies of the Meteoric Temple)\\
*Dracologists discovered a way to harness the power of [[The Woken God]] to power the Meteoric Temple in it's entirety

Other Notable Failures of the First Half Dynasty:

*Millions died due to the initial led piping of the area due to poison in their waters\\
*Hundreds died in the pits of [[The Woken God]] in order to power the [[Meteoric Temple]] which had **not yet even discovered electricity**.
