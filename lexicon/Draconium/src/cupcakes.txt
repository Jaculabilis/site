# Title: The Beautiful Cupcakes of Dr. Ophelia Gumphry from the Underground Academy for Gifted Minds

**An excerpt from //The Lit-Ass Dank Fire Mixtape of MC MOTHER:// Track 69:**

My name is A CONCERNED and I’m here to make it clear\\
Errybody knows cupcakes be why I’m posting here\\
Ophelia came around and destroyed my pure elation\\
By crediting herself for my beautiful creation\\
The underground academy likes to think they’re so righteous\\
But what you don’t know is that those fuckers are spineless

So let me tell you the deal-ia\\
My recipe stolen by Ophelia\\
Don’t believe the mainstream stigma\\
She stole it an hid it outside the [[Enigma|Guage Enigma]]

My rap game is a dream\\
Eco-kitchen has gone green\\
My cake recipe so mean\\
Acclaimed by the Dean\\
My ingredients so lean\\
More flavor than [[Pulluman|Gustivus Pulluman]] cuisine\\
[[Gifted minds behind a screen|Fireminds]]\\
Need the one thing you have seen\\
My cupcakes are the thing\\
But they’re on a space submarine

*mic drop*
