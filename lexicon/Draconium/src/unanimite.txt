Dear Authors of the Lexicon,

It has come to my attention that the artisinally-crafted unanimite lunchbox I won from the raffle at last year’s Lexicon sweater party was stolen from the community refrigerator. I know that the thief must have taken it sometime in the last 3 day (4 day?) revolution of the Guage Enigma.

I will remind you that unanimite is //expensive//, having been created only in a small quantity by [[Kelorna|Kelorna the Extremely Confused]] to turn excess “real world” heat energy quanta into meaningful development of the [[Literarosphere]]. Of course, this has the delightful consequence of causing the box to maintain a permanent and comfortable thirty-six-point-eight degree temperature, but I wouldn’t expect a lunch-pilfering mongoloid such as yourself to have an appreciation for the metal’s finer technical merits. 

[[Gustivus|Gustivus Pulluman]], if this was you again, I swear to [[God|The Woken God]], I’ll see to it personally that the fireminds replace your other arm too. While moxie is an excellent spice, it’s best served warm and untainted by property crime. I think your estranged culinary mentor would agree. Need a “brash” new idea? Don’t 👏 steal 👏 my 👏 lunch.

This is a transcendental and valuable artifact, and isn’t some inconsequential container you can take in and out of the refrigerator – it is my //lunchbox//, and I demand that whoever took it return it immediately. 

Fie on you, filthy food thief! Don’t make me fix my caps lock key!
