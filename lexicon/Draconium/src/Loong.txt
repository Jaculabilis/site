An intriguing species of dragon, noted mainly for their extraordinary flame and unusual intelligence. This breed of dragon became popular amongst keyforgers as their fires were among some of the most potent, to the point where even [[unanimite]] became malleable, leading to the last 13 and 3/2 keys being exclusively made of this rare substance. Indeed, it was not until we learned of the Loong that we were able to learn of this [[technique|The Educational Exploitation of Dragon Fire]].

We keyseekers indeed owe [[Kelorna|Kelorna the Extremely Confused]] a debt of gratitude for her studies of this magnificent breed. Due to groundbreaking studies, we have been able to unlock the secret not only of the forging of the last 13 and 3/2 keys, but we were able to uncover the culinary delight that comes only from cooking with the fire from these extraordinary creatures, the nourishment from which provides the fuel to continue our urgent study into the keys and metakeys of the [[Guage Enigma]].
