# Title: Kevyn: Drogoanthropic Hybrid & Class “B” Dooshbäg

Kevyn, the only known Drogoanthropic Hybrid to date, has recently remerged from his seven hundred year power nap and made an appearance at the recent Dooshbäg conference hosted by my esteemed collegues in the Underground Academy for Gifted Minds. 

Unfortunately, Kevyn had to be asked to leave after getting into a heated debate amongst [[fireminds]] on the values of immortality. Given that Kevyn himself is immortal, it wasn’t long until he began referring to his mortal comrades as merely [[“talonstain”|Talonstain]] and when confronted by the ethics officer of the conference (a class “A” Dooshbäg) he laughed and called him talonstain too, noting that he would outlive any grudge they could hold against him.  

Rumors erupted amongst the class “A” and class “B” Dooshbägs after the encounter resulting in accusations of [[rhellgazing]] and other popular fads recently spreading in the area. As Kevyn was being removed from the conference, I had the pleasure of discussing the [[Key of Xemonides]] with him, which he claims to have in his possession and even alluded to the possibility of its immortality providing qualities. Almost immediately after this admission, he took flight and disappeared into the above ground world, his fleshy drogoanthropic scales flailing with a lapping sound in the wind.

Further insight will be needed to draw any conclusions, but speculation points to a need for this immortal life giving key in order to ever access the Guage Enigma.
