# Title: Codex Ingenuous

The **Codex Ingenuous** is an ancient manuscript consisting of a large compilation of diary entries by the people of [[Ergniramniphoniclufiville]]  

Entries from the young and old depict eye witness accounts of the times when Dragons flew free and among people with little to no conflict, unless you account for the not-so-infrequent village burnings and missing livestock.

Many people believe the **Codex Ingenuous** to be an innocent accounting of the lives of these people with little to no circumstances or implications worth deriving from. There are some people, however, who believe the **Codex Ingenuous** is not this at all, but instead a series of riddles and clues that hold a grave secret, one that left the people of [[Ergniramniphoniclufiville]] to mysteriously disappear. The **Codex Ingenuous** was compiled by scholars in the early 17th century after a group of wanderers happened upon the city, abandoned, with no trace of the previous residents intent to leave or struggle. It appeared that every member of this village between the ages of 8 and 35 kept a journal in the same place, their bedside table, open and exposed directly beside the right end of their beds.

There are many interpretations between scholars as to the true content of this manuscript, being that the original text was written in hieroglyphics for obvious reasons. 

Speculation aside, only half of the **Codex Ingenuous** is even accessible today. In the late 18th century, it was split into two parts. One part, stored in the heavily guarded archives of the Vaticant. The second part, stolen by [[Thrognurith the Dragon Rider]] has been missing, along with him, ever since. Petitions to view and study the **Codex Ingenuous** are rarely met for any purposes barring the study of dragons.
