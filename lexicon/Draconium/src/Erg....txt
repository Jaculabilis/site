**An excerpt from the //Ergniramniphoniclufiville Heights// Season 9 finale **


// The lights come up on KELORNA and JASON, both seated in her apartment’s infernatorium. JASON appears puzzled and concerned, and [[KELORNA|Kelorna the Extremely Confused]] is gesturing wildly, her crooked teeth in a half-smile.//


**KELORNA:** ...and that’s how I’ll retrieve the [[Gauge Enigma]], whether that crafty [[Atherton Guage]] likes it or not!


**JASON:** Oh, Kelorna, I’ve been dying to tell you… the other night when I was lava-boating with Louisa, it wasn’t how it looked at all --


**KELORNA:** I’ll be right back; I’ve got to go engrave my plan on the [[lava slab by my bedside table|Codex Ingenuous]].


// KELORNA exits through the upstage crater. //


**JASON:** Are you writing it on the first half? Or the second half with those [[nice, perforated, tearable pages|Thrognurith the Dragon Rider]]?


**KELORNA** //(muffled)//: The second half, you fool! That’s where all the good secrets go. No doomsday device belongs in the first half, only useless personal ramblings! If somebody could find it a hundred years later and overthink its significance, it belongs in the first half -- a doomsday device is //far// too practical for the first half!


//JASON stands. Soft organ music begins to play.//


**JASON:** Kelorna… I have a confession. I can’t take it anymore! I’ve… I’ve never loved you at all! Every night, as I fall asleep, I’m thinking of Mildred and the fire that burns eternal in her eyes. After her untimely demise, I don’t think I could ever love again!


**KELORNA:** Mildred…? Hmmm… Was she the one I accidentally jettisoned into the Enigma last month?


**JASON:** [[Atherton|Atherton Guage]] was right to leave you! You’re a monster who can’t understand love! All these doomsday devices of yours… the death-helmet, then the flame-mangler… and now it’s this [[Literarosphere]] of yours! Will you ever stop plotting the world’s demise for long enough to for another living being to matter to you at all?


**KELORNA:** No… Wait, hold on, “love”? Is that why you’ve been living in my apartment?


**JASON:** I knew it! I knew this [[volcano|The Woken God]] wouldn’t be big enough for the both of us! I’d sooner burn in a pool of magma than say another word to you!


//JASON leaps out of a window into the fires below.//


**DIRECTOR** //(from off the set, panting)//: Wait! We’ve changed our mind! We’ll re-negotiate your contract!


//KELORNA returns, cackling. She is holding the [[LITERAROSPHERE|Literarosphere]] CONTROLS with both hands. The screen fades to fire while an organ in a deliberately unspecified location swells to a crescendo.//


**JASON / DIRECTOR** //(simultaneously)//: Nooooooooooo!
