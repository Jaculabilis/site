<h2>Codex Ingenuous</h2>
<p>The <b>Codex Ingenuous</b> is an ancient manuscript consisting of a large compilation of diary entries by the people of Ergniramniphoniclufiville<sup>1</sup>  </p></div>
<p>Entries from the young and old depict eye witness accounts of the times when Dragons flew free and among people with little to no conflict, unless you account for the not-so-infrequent village burnings and missing livestock.</p>
<p>Many people believe the <b>Codex Ingenuous</b> to be an innocent accounting of the lives of these people with little to no circumstances or implications worth deriving from. There are some people, however, who believe the <b>Codex Ingenuous</b> is not this at all, but instead a series of riddles and clues that hold a grave secret, one that left the people of Ergniramniphoniclufiville<sup>2</sup> to mysteriously disappear. The <b>Codex Ingenuous</b> was compiled by scholars in the early 17th century after a group of wanderers happened upon the city, abandoned, with no trace of the previous residents intent to leave or struggle. It appeared that every member of this village between the ages of 8 and 35 kept a journal in the same place, their bedside table, open and exposed directly beside the right end of their beds.</p>
<p>There are many interpretations between scholars as to the true content of this manuscript, being that the original text was written in hieroglyphics for obvious reasons. </p>
<p>Speculation aside, only half of the <b>Codex Ingenuous</b> is even accessible today. In the late 18th century, it was split into two parts. One part, stored in the heavily guarded archives of the Vaticant. The second part, stolen by Thrognurith the Dragon Rider<sup>3</sup> has been missing, along with him, ever since. Petitions to view and study the <b>Codex Ingenuous</b> are rarely met for any purposes barring the study of dragons. </p>

<h2>Epiliton</h2>
<p>The third of five hundred and seventeen keys to the famed Guage Enigma, it remains one of the twelve and one-fifth keys to have been identified and archived. Known mainly for its streamed form and blocky cuts, much ink has been spilt into the anatomy of its overall shape. However, what has not been commented upon in enough volume is the nature of its teeth. Containing no less than 83 protoellipses<sup>1</sup>, its craftsmanship remains unparalleled (aside from the Key of Xemonides<sup>2</sup> for obvious reasons), leading some scholars to posit (incorrectly) that this key may have been used as a prototype for a whole range of novel keys. However, upon looking closer to the shape and form of the teeth itself, one can distinctly detect influences from keys 279 and 14, though it undeniably improved vastly upon their character.</p></div>
<p>Alas, were these keys not lost to history we would perhaps be able to unravel some of the origins of the inventions of these keys. Who made them, for what purpose, diabolical or benevolent, and why were they so careless in their storage of such priceless artefacts? Such questions baffle scholars to this day and may never be answered until we properly catalogue the remaining five hundred and four and four fifths keys, truly the challenge of our lifetime.</p>

<h2>Index Ingenuous</h2>
<p>Contemporary dragon science could never have reached the heights it has if it were not for the organizational clarity provided by the <b>Index Ingenuous</b>. While the molten pages of the Codex itslf provide the basis on which all of dragon science is founded, the elaborations of the Appendices Ingenuous<sup>1</sup> encompass more material than is possible to learn in a human lifetime. It is only through the grand ambitions of the Index that this wealth of material can be made accessible to mortals such as ourselves.</p></div>
<p>It is a constant lament of dragon scientists, therefore, that the original Index is missing. Approximately seventy percent of the Index is extant in scans and copies across all professional research teams, and it is suspected that anywhere from two to ten percent of the remaining may be known to private individuals. It is a matter of public record that this unfortunate circumstance is the fault of that dastardly criminal, Mean Petrine the Stealing Machine<sup>2</sup> -- or would be, at any rate, if she hadn't stolen the public records of the incident.</p>
<p>The Index itself is divided into an index proper of significant terms and concepts, a glossary (the shortest section), and a concordance (by far the largest). Nearly half of the glossary is missing from the shared pool of recovered Index pages, as well as some of the most important sections of the concordance.</p>

<h2>Lexicon Draconium</h2>
<p>Dear Authors of the Lexicon,</p></div>
<p>I am <b>done</b> with you and your magazine! In your previous volume, you had the gall to publish a description of a streaming brainsplainer transtelecast<sup>1</sup> in your "article" on the brainsplainer<sup>2</sup>! Is there <b>anyone</b> on your editorial staff who understands the unsubstantiated and obviously existent addictive potential of these devices? Did <b>anyone</b> stop to think that a childarn<sup>3</sup> might pick up a "Lexicon" "Draconium" and read that disgusting article? I don't want to have to explain to a chidl<sup>4</sup> what a transtelecast is when I don't even know what they are!!</p>
<p>Maybe your recklessly irresponsible writers are too young to remember -- but when I grew up, I read the Codex Ingenuous <b>without</b> a brainsplainer, and that's reason enough for me to know that they must be <b>strictly dangerous</b> and <b>obviously unethical</b> -- just like sparking water, antibiotics, and plaid!</p>
<p>Could I have just stopped reading the Lexicon or skipped over that article? Yes, I could have, but it makes me angry that other people might read about a thing that makes me uncomfortable. I will not rest until you've indelibly removed <b>all</b> material that I could construe as threatening to my unspecified and likely inconsistent values from your <b>filthy</b> publication!!</p>
<p>I only want what's best for the childarn<sup>5</sup>! Shouldn't you?!</p>

<h2>Newtprester Resina</h2>
<p><b><i>Newtprester Resina</i></b>, commonly known as <b><i>Tarworms</i></b>, is a species of small dragon endemic to temperate freshwater swamps. A harmless, lazy, social creature, <i>N. Resina</i> can most easily be found in high-end ovens for their peculiar, but predictable, quality of fire. Their diet of small bugs and swamp flowers, and lack of natural predators, indicate that their intricate flames may be a product of their social groupings, rather than a defensive mechanism.</p></div>
<p>Despite <i>N. Resina</i>’s strong resemblance of sea wyrms, they are more closely related to the Eastern Loong<sup>1</sup> than any Western species. <i>N. Resina</i> are easily identified by their size (at most five inches long, including the tail, and three inches wide, excluding the legs), their four long, but fatty, legs, and the sticky, black excretion covering their skin. This substance makes their skins bitter and tough, but the flesh below is buttery and smooth, especially in domesticated varieties.</p>
<p><i>N. Resina</i> are one of the few known species of dragons to be completely amphibious, with individuals having been observed to spend all or none of their lives underwater. Certain, far-removed breeds, such as those found tame in the Meteoric Temple<sup>2</sup>, even possess a capacity for brief, wingless flight, amongst thinner specimens.</p>
<p>In order to exhale fire, these dragons must first inhale swamp gas, which is stored in their diaphragm. Upon exhalation, an exothermic reaction begins to chain. Curiously, this reaction seems to be untenable above 400F, and as a result, secondary fires burst in the main cloud as the temperature fluctuates. Anthropologists speculate that these creatures produce the infamous “Will-o-Wisps” which lure travelers deep into swamps. In order to make use of this strange property, chefs release bottles of methane gas into the Tarworm enclosure fifteen minutes before needing the fire. Once burning, such a flame can last for over an hour, depending on the size of the swarm of <i>N. Resina</i>.</p>

<h2>Talonstain</h2>
<p>Though no dragon has initiated a conversation with a human since the years of the Dragon 
Emperors, they will still converse with Fireminds<sup>1</sup> who engage them in the Firetongue.  
As the Firetongue can only be heard or spoken to another's soul, it is impossible for 
bystanders to glean direct insight from these conversations, and of course the Fireminds 
do not speak of what they have learned.  However, Fireminds often pick up unusual linguistic 
habits, including some telling additions to their vocabulary.  The most common addition is 
the draconic swear word "<b>talonstain</b>."  No precise definition is needed, I think, to 
understand what is meant of the person so labelled, as well as some hints as to how the 
noble ones judge a person's worthiness.  But we do find some interesting usage among the 
authors of the Codex Ingenuous (who were, of course, all Fireminds, with the obvious 
exception of Kelorna the Extremely Confused<sup>2</sup>), some examples of which I share below.</p></div>
<p>In the Chronicles of Wayn, the anonymous poet writes (ln 45,559-45,562):</p>
<p><i>As falls upone the Foe, with mightie furnace-breaths, </i>/<i> So did great Pulchroon, 
deep-tyrant, reduce to </i>/<i> Talonstains the manlings' fears.</i> (This comes, of course, from 
the Steingaärd translation.)</p>
<p>We see here that the word "talonstain" carries connotations of a thing reduced to nothing, 
usually in the context of a violent struggle.  (This framing is shared with depictions of
the dragon therapist Pulchroon elsewhere in the Codex.)  The word easily makes the jump to 
the metaphorical, as seen in Jeminus's "Rout of the Philosophies" (CI #782, p. 27):</p>
<p><i>And Dragon-King Goortros spake, saying, Ye fools, knoweth ye not that your wisdom is 
but talonstains?  Lo, Thraxmanides accosted me, saying, all is that is and all is not that 
is not, but where are his words now that I have eaten him?</i></p>
<p>But of course the word sees simple pejorative use in the Codex as well, as per the Elder 
Fürth's <i>Commentaries</i> on his earlier <i>Transgressive Dialogues</i>:</p>
<p><i>All you talonstains need to just shut up and let the actually enlightened folk do the 
talking.  Okay?  Okay.</i> (CI #1445, p. 394)</p>
<p>As a personal note, the above quote hangs above my door.</p>

<h2>The Educational Exploitation of Dragon Fire</h2>
<p>As we all know from the stories of our youths, Dragon Fire is a fierce and powerful tool that has been feared and loved by the many. As we’ve come to learn further, it can be and has been harnessed in many additional ways to benefit the education of all. </p></div>
<p>Some of its earliest recorded contributions can be seen in its forging of the five hundred and seventeen keys to the famed Guage Enigma, Dragon Fire’s unique smelting qualities were the only way such delicate work could be achieved as seen in the unparalleled details in the protoellipses<sup>1</sup> found in all keys (currently known of) to the Guage Enigma, most observable in Epiliton<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>Other notable instances where Dragon Fire has made positive contributions to society can be traced back to its groundbreaking applications in behavioral correction. Some of the worst criminals were easily made into perfect citizens after a few quick 20-hour sessions of Dragon Fire therapy. One of the greatest successes of the 62 cases where Dragon Fire therapy was used can be seen in the case study of Client 23<sup>3</sup>. While the average temperature of Dragon Fire ranges between 84°C – 73,826°C, it is still unknown how to predict the exact temperature that will be produced at will until it has already been released from the mouth of the dragon (R.I.P. Clients 1- 5, Client 8, Client 11, Client 13, Clients 16-20, Client 22, Clients 25-47, Clients 49-57, and Client 62).</p>

<h2>Haiku of Keysmith Xemoniphon the Elder</h2>
<p>Arguably the most beautiful of anything produced by the Third Dynasty of Meteora<sup>1</sup> (aside from the keys produced obviously), this haiku, crafted by famed keysmith, architect, poet, philosopher, and baker Xemoniphon the Elder<sup>2</sup>, is a metakey to the Guage Enigma. Understanding this enables understanding of the keys, and much like a key, this lovely poem demands understanding, patience, and above all, time.</p></div>
<p><i>Forge the seven keys</i></p>
<p><i>One by four by one by one</i></p>
<p><i>Unlock the one Guage</i></p>
<p>Notice how intricate the numerology winds throughout the poem. Seven keys, followed by seven syllables. The first perfect square number followed by the second, followed by two perfect squares. Scholars have pondered how the pattern would have continued had the poem been in different form (perhaps this question forms yet another metakey). </p>
<p>In any case, Xemoniphon produced this shortly before the fourth set of one hundred keys were produced, and it is an undisputed fact that this haiku enabled Meteora to produce these keys with such swiftness and perfection, and is a vital component of the Codex Ingenuous<sup>3</sup>. It is therefore of tantamount importance that we understand this metakey posthaste, without it even our discovery of new keys will be moot.</p>

<h2>Kelorna the Extremely Confused</h2>
<p>Widely considered the founder of dragon science, <b>Kelorna the Extremely Confused</b> was a Ergniramniphoniclufivillian<sup>1</sup> who, unlike the other members of her village, was not a Firemind. This made her a pariah among the Ergniramniphoniclufivillians. Isolated from her community, she undertook a program of systematic study that would later form the foundations of dragon science. This earned her the ire of her village, as her diary entries in the Codex<sup>2</sup> reveal, culimating in some sort of crisis that coincided with the village's disappearance. The strategies of social enginering she developed, which she called <b>"ingenuosity"</b>, have continued to shape the culture of dragon science up to the present day. Though the normal sense of the word gives a sense of innocence and a lack of duplicity, Kelorna describes ingenuosity as being like a dragon's smile: shiny and spotless, but full of daggers.</p></div>
<p>The true nature of ingenuosity remains something of a unacknowledged consensus. Due to restrictions on studying the Codex itself, the public at large remains ignorant of how explicitly subterfuge is detailed in it. Eggies[1] usually learn quickly through harrowing experience or stolen Kelorna scans. Among professionals, her ingenuous spirit remains alive and well: At the annual Symposium for Extreme Deconfusion held in her honor, the conference rooms are soundproof and fireproof, and fewer researchers leave than enter.</p>
<p>More subtly, consider the rate at which researchers are eaten by their lab's childarn<sup>3</sup> population: despite a chidl being little more than a dragon head with stubby legs, professional dracoscientists are frequently devoured by them just before major research projects are published, which are then taken over by their postdocs. Little is found of these victims except for singed clothing and recently-filed succession papers.</p>

<h2>Meklondiche</h2>
<p>FW: Fw: FW: Found Guage key 71 (Meklondiche)?</p></div>
<p>this gave me the goosebumps!!</p>
<p><i>I’m so unbearably sorry. I think I found it, but I need help. Please.</i></p>
<p><i>Two days ago, I left to search for it just a few miles north of the spires.
I found it. I found the damned thing in a tidy
spine of chryophite poking through the soot, peeking out like it 
</i>wanted<i> me to find it. In my excitement, I extracted it from the rock 
without a second thought. However, to my horror, I noticed that the 
protoellipses<sup>1</sup> were disastrously unbalanced, albeit only </i>after<i> I 
had broken it free. I should have checked first, but the Codex<sup>2</sup> never indicated that Meklondiche would have been one of the 
keys with an ontological cost<sup>3</sup>. God, I wish I’d checked the 
protoellipses first. I’m so sorry.</i></p>
<p><i>Fearing for myself and for anything a few miles around me, I scrambled 
for my notes on the Codex, poring over them in the ash until there was 
no longer light to see, clutching the key as if my grip could keep it in 
this plane. Oddly, the key had not shown any signs of decreation. 
Feeling encouraged by this fact, I started to look for a place to sleep. 
Not a moment had my thoughts strayed when Meklondiche flickered and 
withered in my hand. I knew the cost immediately: attention. Meklondiche 
will remain only as long as you give it your thoughts.</i>
 
<i>I can’t sleep until somebody else feeds it – I fear that my dreams won’t be 
enough. I’m terrified to think what it might take with it were it to 
disappear. Please, forward this e-mail to as many people as you can. The 
more people think about the key, the safer we’ll all be.</i></p>
<p>send this to <b>no fewer than seven</b> distinguished scholars in the next 
hour… we can’t afford to lose another!!</p>

<h2>Surf and Turf</h2>
<p><b>Surf and Turf</b> describes a wide variety of meals including meat elements from both seafood and some form of land-based meat. Popular choices for the seafood element may be lobster, giant rock crab, or salmon, while the “turf” can be anything from beef rib to dragonsteak. Certain, particularly skilled and artistic artists pair closely related meats, such as fatty sea wyrm cutlets and yellow dragon rib to show off subtle and expert handling in the art of comparison.</p></div>
<p>Surf and Turf, while a challenging meal, offers great reward to those who master it. Above all else, the versatility in choosing from infinite combinations and pairings mean that each preparation is filled with personality and artistic vision. The key is finding a unifying factor, and exploring the differences from there. Some food critics prefer the earthy, poultry flavor of cockatrice, complemented with the salty licorice strandiness of Elder Sea Serpent<sup>1</sup>. The small, confusing people<sup>2</sup>, on the other hand, may enjoy the simple, but effective, combination of shrimp and ground hydra in a burger or chili.</p>
<p>From the remaining portions of Index Ingenuous<sup>3</sup>, we know that dragonflesh operates differently than any other types of meat. Notably, for practical purposes, the muscles tend to grain in spurious and odd directions. While beefsteak and salmon should generally be cut against the grain, this presents a problem for preparing either aquatic or terrestrial dragon, but as with all problems in cooking, this simply offers more possibilities. One can try to find a major grain to cut against for tenderness, or slow-roast the meat, so it will flake anyways.</p>

<h2>The Woken God</h2>
<p>We mortals revere dragons for being larger, angrier, and more fiery than us.  We imagine 
that the dragons have no corresponding entity, but this is not true, because there are 
indeed entities larger, angrier, and more fiery than dragons: that is, volcanoes.  And none 
are larger, angrier, or more fiery than their holiest volcano: "<b>The Woken God</b>", or, as 
the dragons call it, "Woaorarglarghrargh".  (The usual caveats about draconic transliterations 
apply here.)</p></div>
<p>Writings about Woken God are, of course, highly intertwined with the history of the 
Codex Ingenuous<sup>1</sup>, being that it was written upon the mountain's heart.  And rightly does 
de Sobrel note<sup>2</sup> that "dragon science could never have reached the heights 
it has if not for the [...] Index Ingenuous", as it was the latter text that revealed the 
long-lost hieroglyphic arts of the Ergniramniphoniclufivillians<sup>3</sup>, 
whose city was discovered abandoned inside the mountain.  As an aside, it is important 
to note that de Sobrel is being completely literal here: the aforementioned arts made the 
upper reaches of the volcano passable to enterprising scholars for the first time.</p>
<p>Set atop Woken God is the Meteoric Temple<sup>4</sup>, the draconic monastery that many know as 
the Vaticant.  Though the dracomonks heavily encourage mortal study of the noble ones—
one recalls Hlurfo Heiferbane's somewhat cheeky jest that <i>frærthe glursha nel kibbtr poom 
enr sagatha simmimür</i> (though some, e.g. Hannon <i>et al</i>, have suggested he was actually 
making a veiled analogy about the tax policies of his day)—they are notoriously silent on 
the inner workings of their worship of the mountain, or of the Meteoric Order in general.</p>
<p>One cannot conclude an epigraph on the Woken God, of course, without quoting the final words 
of the esteemed explorer Zeminih Sutoba (CI #716, p. 30): </p>
<p><i>In all my living days, never have I seen such grandeur, a landmark ablaze with such beauty.  
Behold, she burns, and I am set alight.  Put me out, Senethal.  For God's sake, Senethal, 
stop writing and put me out.  Forget history, I'm on fire here.  Aruogarlagraeh.</i> [Note: again, 
draconic transliteration is difficult, and scholars are divided on what exactly Sutoba was 
trying to say.  For further discussion see Gloorville's <i>Rise and Fall</i>: <i>The Fates and 
Fame of the Great Eastern Explorers</i>.]</p>

<h2>Atherton Guage</h2>
<p>A quixotic and storied figure in Codex<sup>1</sup> lore, <b>Atherton Guage</b> is the 
subject of so many wildly varying tales that all of them cannot possibly true—a fact, it 
must be said, that draws Bardslayer attention like bloody water draws sea wyrms.  Given 
extant writings on the man, I will merely offer a brief summary.</p></div>
<p>Our actual evidence of Guage's life is scant.  We know from the Codex Ingenuous that he was 
a prominent figure in Ergniramniphoniclufiville<sup>2</sup> and a contemporary—and political opponent—of 
Kelorna the Extremely Confused<sup>3</sup>.  Though referred to only as the "Wheelmind" in the Codex, 
comments by Kelorna in the present day confirm that Guage was her primary opponent during 
final batch of experiments that are presumed to have resulted in Ergniramniphoniclufiville's 
disappearance.  Unfortunately, most of these comments are off-handed references, collected 
from the transcripts of her characteristic monologues while e.g. unleashing another doomsday 
device or blowing up the current head of government.  And since undergoing dragonfire-induced 
radical behavior modification therapy<sup>4</sup>, Kelorna 
has ceased being <i>ingenuously</i> "extremely confused", and is now, to all appearances, <i>actually</i>
extremely confused.  It seems unlikely she will be able to provide further information.</p>
<p>Guage's most notable accomplishment, however, needs no immortal supervillain to confirm its 
existence.  To prevent the power of the Gauge Enigma<sup>5</sup> from falling into the wrong hands 
(that is, Kelorna's), he brought forth a great working that remains without equal to this day.  
Lirian Inkbowels put it particularly well: </p>
<p><i>Dark the brow, quick the fingers of the Wheelmind as raised he a bulwark 'gainst the unworthy.  
Wheels of fire issued forth from the ground, and the Gauge Enigma</i>[1]<i> was enshrined in the sky, 
warded forever.</i>  (CI #209, p. 147)</p>
<p>I hardly need explain at this point that this is why the all-encompassing network of metal 
gears in the sky is known as the "Guage Enigma".  The ever-shifting patterns among the gears 
make for an excellent deterrent for those like Kelorna, who is bad at math.  However, it 
is unlikely it will stop those like the estimable D. R. Loblaw, whose 
groundbreaking<sup>6</sup> work<sup>7</sup> 
on the Guage Enigma would surely advance the field if he were invited to conferences anymore.[2]</p>

<h2>Hans, the Great Merchant of Dragons and Men</h2>
<p>As we know, there are still five hundred and four and four fifths keys missing to the great Guage Enigma. Recent speculators believe that our best lead to find no less than twenty seven more keys lies with Hans, the Great Merchant of Dragons and Men. </p></div>
<p>Hans, brother of Mean Petrine the Stealing Machine<sup>1</sup>, is the only merchant to have ever been rumored to deal with both humans and dragons alike. As a firemind<sup>2</sup>, Hans had the ability to speak to all dragons which no doubt made selling and buying from them a much simpler task. Reason to believe that Hans may have a substantial number of the missing keys is drawn from a few eyewitness accounts, one stated as follows:</p>
<p>“I saw Hans, the Great Merchant of Dragons and Men, he was walking around in golden shoes and dragon scale garments when I heard him say, ‘I’ve got no less than twenty seven keys to the Guage Enigma’ which led me to believe that he must have no less than twenty seven keys to the Guage Enigma. He also has a woman with him, I think her name was…” </p>
<p>The account ends there as the records have been torn and the rest was stolen.</p>
<p>Hans is often rumored to have been immortal or otherwise dead. His home rests on the base of The Woken God<sup>3</sup> and if there is any hope to finding these twenty seven more keys he is thought to have, it would be found there in his home where he is either alive, dead, or not there at all.</p>

<h2>Loong</h2>
<p>An intriguing species of dragon, noted mainly for their extraordinary flame and unusual intelligence. This breed of dragon became popular amongst keyforgers as their fires were among some of the most potent, to the point where even unanimite<sup>1</sup> became malleable, leading to the last 13 and 3/2 keys being exclusively made of this rare substance. Indeed, it was not until we learned of the Loong that we were able to learn of this technique<sup>2</sup>.</p></div>
<p>We keyseekers indeed owe Kelorna<sup>3</sup> a debt of gratitude for her studies of this magnificent breed. Due to groundbreaking studies, we have been able to unlock the secret not only of the forging of the last 13 and 3/2 keys, but we were able to uncover the culinary delight that comes only from cooking with the fire from these extraordinary creatures, the nourishment from which provides the fuel to continue our urgent study into the keys and metakeys of the Guage Enigma<sup>4</sup>.</p>

<h2>Ordo Draco</h2>
<p>Dragon scientists recognize 14 families of dragons under the order <i>Draco</i>, following the classification first proposed by the <i>Empyreal Compendium of Beneficent Wisdom</i>. The families are, briefly:</p></div>
<p>• <b>Imperatoris</b> - Imperatorids, also known as "greater dragons", are the largest dracoforms, with most genera having wingspans and body lengths in the tens of meters. The extinct[1] species <i>Sacramerda maxima</i> is conjectured to have had a body length on the order of a hundred meters.<br>
• <b>Condentes</b> - Most smaller dracoforms are condents, such as tarworms<sup>1</sup>, though some condents are larger. Most condents have highly adapted dermal tissue suited to their environment.<br>
• <b>Conformata</b>, <b>Porca</b>, <b>Sirena</b> - Conformates, porcates, and sirens were all hunted to extinction by Thrognurith the Dragon Rider<sup>2</sup>, who then destroyed most of the scholarly corpus on them.<br>
• <b>Fabulosa</b> - The fabulosates are a now-extinct family of dracoforms characterized by being entirely fictional.<br>
• <b>Canes</b>, <b>Conjecta</b> - Canids and conjectates are characterized by their unique spirations. Canids utilize unique methods to generate heat, while conjectates utilize chemical reactions that draw heat out of the target to freeze it rather than combust it.<br>
• <b>Trementes</b> - The only trement genus is <i>Utinsanus</i>, which was given its own family after it made the other imperatorids uncomfortable.<br>
• <b>Innumerabiles</b> - We do not speak of <i>Innumerabiles</i>[2].<br>
• <b>Picta</b> - Pictates are theorized to exist, but have yet to be observed.<br>
• <b>Cetera</b> - The ceterates consist mostly of dracoforms that dracologists haven't succeeded in classifying elsewhere.<br>
• <b>Frangentes</b> - Frangents are distinguished from other dracoforms primarily by their morphological adaptations for complex mating calls, which are also used for weakening solid structures prior to breathing fire.<br>
• <b>Muscae</b> - Flocks of birds in the shape of a dragon, muscates were not classified in the order <i>Draco</i> until they raided a military complex and made off with the flamethrowers. After a tense standoff at a dragon science symposium<sup>3</sup>, dracologists agreed to write them into the draconic taxonomy.</p>

<h2>Rhellgazing</h2>
<p><b>Is your teen “rhellgazing?” Know the risks!</b></p></div>
<p>Has your teen come home after curfew with darkened eye-pits or a scaly 
hide? If so, he or she may have fallen prey to the latest teenage craze: 
“rhellgazing”.</p>
<p>“Rhellgazing” involves staring directly at the blindingly iridescent 
walls of the Meteoric Temple<sup>1</sup> from afar, often for extended periods 
of time. While unsubstantiated by the Codex Ingenuous<sup>2</sup>, legend 
maintains that the practice owes its beginnings to Kelorna the Extremely Confused<sup>3</sup>, who began “rhellgazing” late in her life. The 
inspiration for the name, or what the “Rhell” could be, is completely 
unknown to modern dragon science. </p>
<p>Perplexingly, participants are typically unable to describe the 
experience, but are drawn to repeat it, and typically gain a fanatical 
interest in the dragon sciences. Usually, this fascination occurs at the 
expense of their mental faculties and personal identities.</p>
<p>Telltale signs that your teen has been “rhellgazing” include:<br>
* Acne<br>
* Defiant behavior<br>
* Becoming a pillar of ash<br>
* Ｓｐｅａｋｉｎｇ ｉｎ ｕｎｉｃｏｄｅ<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>Just as real as the risks of “rhellgazing” are its associations: the 
practice is a rite of passage for several organized crime rings, 
particularly those involved in the odious crime of fire-fighting.</p>
<p>Parents suspecting their teens of “rhellgazing” should attempt to ignite 
them – resistance to total incineration is a certain indicator of their 
participation in this troubling fad.</p>

<h2>Turtledragons</h2>
<p><b>Turtledragons</b> (not to be confused with Turtledoves) are a classification of dragons endemic to the area around the volcanic islands of the Scorialic Sea<sup>1</sup>. Their semi-protoelliptic<sup>2</sup> bumps, many, many sharp teeth, and propensity to spit electrically-charged oil at prey differentiate them from otherwise docile sea-turtles. Although they are a popular draw for tourists, especially around breeding times, leading dracosociologists note the high rate of amputations resulting from turtledragon-spit-related-accidents reflects a seemingly high disregard for personal safety.</p></div>
<p>Due to recent legal kerfuffle, it is currently illegal to consume the mild, bubbly flesh these species are famous for. Recent social movements (seemingly tracing back to a series of spam messages) make broad, improbable claims about “major population decline” and “disappearing herds”. This legislation technically allows for the breeding of turtledragons, but given their propensity to deflate in any enclosure, this solution seems untenable for the bold, electrifying chefs of today.</p>
<p>Turtledragons’ lineage is a subject of much scientific debate. Some scholars think turtledragons evolved from dragons which, after evolving a hard shell in terrestrial swamps, moved back into the sea, and their resemblance to sea-turtles is a product of convergent evolution. Other scholars argue the teeth, markings, and spit are evolved from a sea-turtle to begin with, and their resemblance to dragons stems from convergent evolution on the other side. Yet others believe that the species is a product of interbreeding between dragons and sea-turtles, or intermediate stages. Notably, none of these lineages account for their specific locality in the Scorialic Sea. Never mentioned in the known pages of the Index Ingenuous<sup>3</sup>, ecologists are reduced to wild speculation and discordant and unreliable means of population measurement.</p>

<h2>Elder Sea Serpent</h2>
<p>Nigh-mythical sea-dragons of legendarily destructive potential, <b>Elder Sea Serpents</b> (taxonomic
name <i>piscis grandis horribilis</i>, of the family <i>Imperatoris</i><sup>1</sup>; also known as <b>Leviathans</b>) 
are the primary reason that there are no coastal settlements with population in excess of fifty thousand 
souls.  Whether this is the direct result of Elder Sea Serpent predation or a mere reflection 
of their reputation is a matter of scholarly debate; the fact remains that most[1] do not care 
to investigate the matter personally.</p></div>
<p>Historical accounts suggest that Elder Sea Serpents are native to the Scorialic Sea<sup>2</sup>, but 
there is no small measure of uncertainty here—it is difficult to interpret Elder Sea Serpents' 
presence in the historical record.  For one, members of the species show little of their 
terrestrial cousins' proclivity toward announcing their identities.  Compare this passage 
from Cullus (CI #445, ln 4603-4606): </p>
<p><i>Descended the noble one upon the fold;</i> <br>
<i>Boometh he, "I am Greattooth the Large!"</i> <br>
<i>And then he devoured them all.</i></p>
<p>with this passage from Tarion the Younger (CI #467, p. 217):</p>
<p><i>Hungering for flesh of man, from deep the great one rose.</i> <br>
<i>"Tell us who you are, o terror," cried the warriors, "that we may worship you."</i> <br>
<i>"Gift us with your name, o master" cried the women and children, "that we may die with it on our lips."</i> <br>
<i>But he regarded them silently,</i> <br>
<i>And then he devoured them all.</i></p>
<p>Both passages are quite typical of depictions of draconic feedings, and I could have illustrated 
the point with any number of authors.  However, Cullus and Tarion the Younger make for an especially 
instructive comparison, as they were contemporaries, both writing out of the Carthusian oral 
tradition.  (Astute readers will note the stock phrase "and then he devoured them all" which 
concludes both passages—Carthusian storytellers had a number of stock phrases like these, 
which were used to express extremely common ideas.)</p>
<p>Another interpretive barrier is ancient writers' tendency to introduce Leviathans into their 
narratives as metaphors for violent change.  Hence, for example, Norwis of Julius's insistence 
that the Leper King was carried off by an Elder Sea Serpent, while other contemporary accounts 
render it a typical case of the secret taxmen<sup>3</sup> disappearing an uncooperative 
sovereign.  But we cannot safely assume that all such depictions are metaphors, as it is 
well-documented that Leviathans sometimes <i>do</i> attempt to make off with heads of state. (See, for 
example, the debacle at the Potentate's coronation last year).</p>
<p>However, a concluding note: these are exciting times, and more of the Codex Ingenuous<sup>4</sup> is 
discovered every day. I have the fullest confidence that the truth will win out over the stories 
in the end.</p>

<h2>Kevyn: Drogoanthropic Hybrid & Class “B” Dooshbäg</h2>
<p>Kevyn, the only known Drogoanthropic Hybrid to date, has recently remerged from his seven hundred year power nap and made an appearance at the recent Dooshbäg conference hosted by my esteemed collegues in the Underground Academy for Gifted Minds. </p></div>
<p>Unfortunately, Kevyn had to be asked to leave after getting into a heated debate amongst fireminds<sup>1</sup> on the values of immortality. Given that Kevyn himself is immortal, it wasn’t long until he began referring to his mortal comrades as merely “talonstain”<sup>2</sup> and when confronted by the ethics officer of the conference (a class “A” Dooshbäg) he laughed and called him talonstain too, noting that he would outlive any grudge they could hold against him.  </p>
<p>Rumors erupted amongst the class “A” and class “B” Dooshbägs after the encounter resulting in accusations of rhellgazing<sup>3</sup> and other popular fads recently spreading in the area. As Kevyn was being removed from the conference, I had the pleasure of discussing the Key of Xemonides<sup>4</sup> with him, which he claims to have in his possession and even alluded to the possibility of its immortality providing qualities. Almost immediately after this admission, he took flight and disappeared into the above ground world, his fleshy drogoanthropic scales flailing with a lapping sound in the wind.</p>
<p>Further insight will be needed to draw any conclusions, but speculation points to a need for this immortal life giving key in order to ever access the Guage Enigma.</p>

<h2>Meteoric Temple</h2>
<p>Otherwise known as the Vaticant, this is the seat of power for the mighty dracomonks, but most importantly, it is where some of the most brilliant keys in history were produced. I have written extensively on the fourth set of one hundred keys, but the remarkable fact of the Meteoric Temple is that this ranks only third on the list of their most notable accomplishments. The First Half Dynasty of Meteora<sup>1</sup> laid down not only the framework for the creation of a key, it conducted extensive studies on protoellipses and the ontology<sup>2</sup> of their numbers. Atherton Guage<sup>3</sup> extensively studied the effects of prime numbers on a key at this site, and in so doing created key 14, or so the stories say. Key 14 is the first key[1]  to contain not only a prime amount of protoellipses, but a stunning quantity of 79, a feat that remained unsurpassed until the creation of Epiliton. </p></div>
<p>The location of the Meteoric Temple upon The Woken God<sup>4</sup> assists with the forging and research of keys, though not without risk<sup>5</sup>. The lava that constantly erupts upon it makes work hostile, but provides the necessary material and energy to conduct such important research.</p>
<p>Of a more minor note, some remarkable species of dragons may be found here, the biological study of which<sup>6</sup> has little to do with keys, which is surely a shame.</p>

<h2>Protoellipses</h2>
<p>Heat. Pressure. The taste of metallic air. Trying to scream, but hearing only silence. The weightless sensation of falling. These phenomena and others like them are common in <b>protoellipses</b> (via Greek, lit. <i>protos</i> "first" + <i>elleipsis</i> "omission"), psychic impressions encoded into the Guage Keys by the psychic effects of dragon fire<sup>1</sup>. The term "protoellipsis" originates from dragonfire therapy, where negative phenomenological states are scoured from the mind and crystalized into small, globular crystals. It was believed that only the first mental states thus scoured would crystallize, hence "proto", but later research determined that further states were simply encoded deeper into the crystal. The term nevertheless persists.</p></div>
<p>Dragons possess the mental fortitude to endure protoelliptic visions, and some are even known to weaponize them in self-defense<sup>2</sup>. We mortals, lacking such strength, must borrow it. As is well-documented in Gustivus Pulluman's celebrated <i>Seventy Yet More Unexpected Recipes for Dragonflesh</i>, regularly consuming dragon meat virtually eliminates the negative effects of protoellipses. Most dragonfire therapists and Guage Key researchers, however, lack Pulluman's ability to slay dragons in single combat, and rely instead on the aid of brainsplainers<sup>3</sup> to withstand the mental stress. Those who forgo such precautions risk suffering from protoelliptic psychic shock<sup>4</sup>, better known by its vulgar name, "key madness".</p>
<p>Despite the august grandeur of that age in which the Guage Keys were forged, it seems that key madness is as old as the keys themselves. Scholars generally agree that Codex Ingenuous<sup>5</sup> #1446 describes similar symptoms (p. 2):</p>
<p><i>Bearing the spiral</i>[1]<i> aloft, so prayed the circle:</i><br>
<i>"What could possibly go wrong?<sup>6</sup> For lo,</i><br>
<i>This key we obtained for talonstains<sup>7</sup>."</i><br>
<i>So they intoned and in minds-eye turned inward,</i><br>
<i>And then heat devoured them all.</i></p>
<hr><span class="signature"><p> Heraclitavian de Sobrel, dracophenomenologist</p></span>
<p>[1] The hieroglyph translated here as "spiral" is found nowhere else in the Codex except for a single passage describing the shape of a key thought to be Meklondiche<sup>8</sup>, hence the translation after that key's characteristic shape.</p>

<h2>Unanimite</h2>
<p>Dear Authors of the Lexicon,</p></div>
<p>It has come to my attention that the artisinally-crafted unanimite lunchbox I won from the raffle at last year’s Lexicon sweater party was stolen from the community refrigerator. I know that the thief must have taken it sometime in the last 3 day (4 day?) revolution of the Guage Enigma.</p>
<p>I will remind you that unanimite is <i>expensive</i>, having been created only in a small quantity by Kelorna<sup>1</sup> to turn excess “real world” heat energy quanta into meaningful development of the Literarosphere<sup>2</sup>. Of course, this has the delightful consequence of causing the box to maintain a permanent and comfortable thirty-six-point-eight degree temperature, but I wouldn’t expect a lunch-pilfering mongoloid such as yourself to have an appreciation for the metal’s finer technical merits. </p>
<p>Gustivus<sup>3</sup>, if this was you again, I swear to God<sup>4</sup>, I’ll see to it personally that the fireminds replace your other arm too. While moxie is an excellent spice, it’s best served warm and untainted by property crime. I think your estranged culinary mentor would agree. Need a “brash” new idea? Don’t 👏 steal 👏 my 👏 lunch.</p>
<p>This is a transcendental and valuable artifact, and isn’t some inconsequential container you can take in and out of the refrigerator – it is my <i>lunchbox</i>, and I demand that whoever took it return it immediately. </p>
<p>Fie on you, filthy food thief! Don’t make me fix my caps lock key!</p>

<h2>Xemoniphon the Elder</h2>
<p>Xemoniphon the Elder is a famed artist who lived in the Third Dynasty of Meteora<sup>1</sup>, which in itself was no easy feat. Most famous for the Haiku of Keysmith Xemoniphon the Elder<sup>2</sup>, Xemoniphon’s works in philosophy, poetry, numerology, and baking culminated in the creation of many keys, apparently at the behest of none other than Atherton Guage<sup>3</sup> himself. The exact number of keys created in Xemoniphon’s time is unknown, as is his particular role in their creation.</p></div>
<p>Unlike many other figures of his time, certain details of Xemoniphon’s life are known, both from the Codex Ingenuous<sup>4</sup> and other firsthand artifacts, surviving despite (or perhaps because of) his mortality. Indeed, many such documents seem to reference his impending death. From a love/hate-letter from Fiona the Too-Young-To-Die to Wilfred the Impulsive, we know he was accidentally conceived during a particularly distressing act of ingenuosity by Kelorna the Extremely Confused<sup>5</sup>. He took an apprenticeship at the remains of a library where he was tasked with reconstructing scraps of books, and subsequently fired when the librarian realized he couldn’t read. From there, he took a job at a bakery, where the exposure to dragonfire ovens seemed to change him<sup>6</sup>.</p>
<p>According to a resurfaced court record, two years after this supposed change in personality, a lawsuit formed of families of customers who reportedly had gone insane upon consumption of his croissants (among the complainants was the wife of a former head-baker in the shop). The suit claimed these croissants used “an unreasonable number of dimensions” and “uncountably finite” folds of butter. This lawsuit was dismissed after Exhibit A reportedly gave the judge a brief seizure, during which the judge absolved him of all blame by blinking wildly and convulsing on the floor. The decision was appealed, but due to double jeopardy laws, fell through. This suit purportedly attracted the attention of many famed scholars of the day, in particular Atherton, as detailed in a parable in the Codex Ingenuous, the Delicious Temptation of the Wheelmind.</p>
<p>The fame of the Haiku leads some scholars to disregard the importance of his baking, but in truth, baking was the ultimate source of his many skills. For what more performative art is there than in the fleeting bites of a meal well cooked? Xemoniphon pioneered many of the famed dragonfire and keysmithing techniques in his time as a patissier. According to a take-out menu, one of the most popular items served was a cupcake, which tasted exactly how people thought it tasted<sup>7</sup>.</p>
<p>The death of Xemoniphon is haughtily debated amongst scholars. Some argue that it was an act of Kelorna, others say the roving dragons got to him first, and others point to an intriguing story in the Codex itself, in which he popped into thin air after disproving his existence by a series of petit fours. </p>

<h2>Appendices Ingenuous</h2>
<p>The Appendices Ingenuous are a large collection of documents from Ergniramniphoniclufiville<sup>1</sup> before its mysterious depopulation. Although less famous than the Codex Ingenuous<sup>2</sup>, the Appendices contain a good deal more information, as the Codex consists entirely of diary entries, and the Appendices include everything from religious texts to take-out menus. Fortunately, the Index Ingenuous<sup>3</sup> exists to orient those who may attempt to parse such, even if the Index is, in part, misplaced, and almost as confusing as the Appendices themselves. It has been remarked that one who masters such navigation may be able to claim distinction in any number of draco-sciences, regardless of other knowledge or qualifications.</p></div>
<p>The location of the Appendices Ingenuous is a complicated matter, but it was not always such. Upon its discovery and compilation, it seems that various documents spread throughout varies universities and academies, with a longstanding pact that any resource must be accessible, in some form or another, to any academic in decent standing. This could be enforced with the full Index, as it detailed where any article may be found. Alas, such is not the case, and since, many articles have disappeared from their institutions. In cases where the loss is discovered, the curators unequivocally point to Mean Petrine the Stealing Machine<sup>4</sup> as the culprit, and refuse to comment on the connections between the missing articles and stunningly original academic work produced thereafter. It should come as a great relief to many that many originals of the Appendices are currently stored in the impenetrable Underground Academy, with their strong focus on legalistic ethics and very passable cafeteria.</p>
<p>The Appendices’ size is directly tied to its source and history. Since, in its time, dragon and human academics often worked together, much of the more academic work is, in fact, translations of other texts. However, the non-academic work should not be undervalued. With such documents, we gain a clearer picture of the most important heroes of the past, contextualization of the Codex, and some of our only information on dracosociology and the restaurants of the day. </p>
<p>Upon attempting to engage with the text, it should be noted that the units specified often do not correlate with our present-day units, despite similar naming conventions, and this separation only worsens when trying to convert between thus. Even seemingly objective measures, like proportions in the recipe-books, fail to produce repeatable results, despite being highly consistent throughout.</p>

<h2>Guage Enigma</h2>
<p>Not to be confused with the <i>Gauge Enigma</i>, the <b>Guage Enigma</b> is a complex system of 
metal gears covering the entire atmosphere.  It is commonly accepted that the Guage Enigma 
was created by Atherton Guage for the sole purpose of preventing Kelorna the Extremely Confused<sup>1</sup> 
from accessing the Great Secret.  However, recent scholarship on the Codex Ingenuous<sup>2</sup> 
has challenged this narrative, and at least from a textural criticism standpoint, their 
thesis is quite compelling.</p></div>
<p>The initial argument, known as the "Red Herring Thesis", comes from the character of the 
Wheelmind himself, as discussed by the anonymous author of CI #206: </p>
<p><i>Man or devil—it is not given to man to know the inner thoughts of the Wheelmind.  
Once you think you have grasped the scheme behind the scheme, you have but fallen into a 
third scheme, and yet none of those schemes had anything to do with his true purpose.</i> (p. 89)  </p>
<p>These sentiments are shared by many sources, apparently including Atherton Guage himself—the 
Guage family motto roughly translates to "Never do anything for only one reason."  Thus, 
the scholars argue, the Guage Enigma likely served some purpose in addition to stalling Kelorna.</p>
<p>The Red Herring Thesis emerged around the same time as a concurrent development within the 
niche field of historical kleidiology.  Careful analysis of the Index Ingenuous<sup>3</sup> reveals 
that the production of keys actually <i>predates</i> the Guage Enigma.  Indeed, between the keys' 
strange ontological<sup>4</sup> and phenomenological<sup>5</sup> properties, 
it is questionable why such advanced items would be needed to "unlock" a mere assembly of 
metal gears, especially when enigmonomers have yet to discover even one keyhole through 
telescopic observation.</p>
<p>Thus, we arrive at what is being termed the "Phylactery Hypothesis", which posits that the keys 
were actually designed as repositories for mortal souls.  Though there are numerous references 
within the Codex to a relation between the keys and the Guage Enigma, they use the preposition 
"<i>λεστ</i>"; thus, the phrase "keys to the Guage Enigma" could also be translated 
"keys <i>for</i> the Guage Enigma."  This rendering would make the keys a <i>means of passage</i> 
into or through the Enigma.  By the relocation of the soul to an enduring apparatus, a 
mortal could theoretically avoid death indefinitely.  And indeed, some 
immortals<sup>6</sup> have hinted that this 
is in fact the case for some of the better-preserved keys.</p>
<p>The Phylactery Hypothesis also sheds new light on ambiguities in the 
Haiku of Keysmith Xemoniphon the Elder<sup>7</sup>.  Kleidiologists have long puzzled over his phrase 
"forge the seven keys", as over 500[1] keys are known to exist.  But suppose that only seven keys 
<i>functioned as phylacteries</i>.  The pattern "one by four by one by one" corresponds chronologically 
to Atherton Guage's known<sup>8</sup> key-forging<sup>9</sup> activity<sup>10</sup>; 
Xemoniphon, greatest of the Keysmiths, may have been saying that "forging" (in the sense of
"imitating" or "progressing along") Guage's journey of development is necessary to 
understand what he was doing—i.e., "Unlock the one Guage".</p>
<p>If that's the case, then it suddenly becomes clear why eyewitness accounts report that Xemoniphon

<h2>Ontological cost</h2>
<p>on·to·log·i·cal cost<br>
ˌän(t)əˈläjək(ə)l ‘ kôst/<br>
<i>DRACOPHILOSOPHY</i><br>
1. The price, value, or figure put on a person, place, or thing relating to the branch of metaphysics dealing with the nature of being.</p></div>
<p>Within everything from the reason you exist in the first place all the way to the best damned baked goods you’ve ever experienced, there is an ontological cost. 
The metaphysical properties of dragon fire have been linked to a direct correlation between what is and what is not costly, in the ontological sense of course. 
In cases like the noted email chain regarding Meklondiche<sup>1</sup> (Guage key 71) , spread by a “concerned mother,” we see the catastrophic effects of misinterpretation. An ontological cost is a simple thing to calculate, as seen below in the approved graph for ontological costs in metaphysics 101 at the Underground Academy for Gifted Minds:</p>
<p><i>*Image Unavailable to anyone not enrolled in the Underground Academy for Gifted Minds, ENROLL TODAY!! <sup>2</sup>*</i></p>
<p>As we see here in the graph (color coded to the common knowledge of corresponding dimensions) it takes a very specific level of thought attributed to the awareness of an object, such as a key, to keep it in its current metaphysical state. Once exceeding a certain point, the metaphysics shift and the dimension in which the object exists will also shift (clearly demonstrated in the above graph), so the poor soul that found Meklondiche has probably been slingshot to a far off dimension by now if that email chain continued at its exponential rate.</p>
<p>Applying the appropriate levels of attention and awareness to an object, such as my cupcake I had today<sup>3</sup>, you can fulfil the ontological cost and define the metaphysics of its properties. I, myself, knew there would be no better flavor than that of the tarworm<sup>4</sup> and therefore that is the delicious flavor I tasted as I bit into my prize winning cupcakes.</p>
<p>It is important that I also note the dangers of opening spam mail from <b><i>uncredited</i></b> sources.
Do not mess with the imbalances of ontological cost, because we all know what happens to those who do<sup>5</sup>.</p>

<h2>Scorialic Sea</h2>
<p>A body of water with a most dire history, the Scorialic Sea is home to a number of dragon species,[1] and also boasts a remarkable geography consisting of both fertile and barren islands, ruined by both dragon fire and volcanoes. It is here that the Meteoric Temple<sup>1</sup> is found, built at the mouth of the mighty Woken God<sup>2</sup>.</p></div>
<p>The Scorialic Sea boasts of nine islands of various sizes (notice the perfect square again, perhaps inspiring Xemoniphon the Elder<sup>3</sup> in his crafting of both keys and poetry). One island is fertile, no volcanoes being found. One island has two volcanoes, whereas two islands have three apiece. The remaining five have dormant volcanoes, yet mysteriously their lands have not regrown yet, possibly due to their being the location<sup>4</sup> of the forging of the famous Key of Xemonides<sup>5</sup>.</p>
<p>The Vaticant maintained a strong hold in the sea and its surrounding lands. It wasn’t until the end of the Third Meteoric Dynasty where the noble dracomonks attempted to forge unanimite<sup>6</sup> keys without the proper metaphysics in place. A psychical backblast from the Loong destroyed most Vaticant presence, leaving only the Meteoric Temple<sup>7</sup> standing. It is postulated that famed dracoscientist Kelorna<sup>8</sup> first developed her extreme confusion due to this backblast, leading to her rise to fame, a rise only matched by her descent into actual confusion. It is due to her research at the Scorialic Sea that we have Keys 138 and 134 3/2, and so we key scientists owe both the psychic backblast and the esteemed scientist Kelorna a great debt of gratitude.</p>

<h2>Unicode</h2>
<p><i>Found among the papers of Heraclitavian de Sobrel during his sick leave</i></p></div>
<hr><span class="signature"><p></p></span>
<p><b>Unicode</b>, also known as <b>unus codex</b>, is a strange and recent phenomenon in which persons become catatonic and speak only in a quasi-artificial, monotone dialect about "making one the Codex<sup>1</sup>". Such individuals tend to become highly motivated to collect the disparate sections of the Codex -- an admirable impetus, except that these individuals do not do something so useful to dragon science as seek out lost or stolen sections of the Codex. Rather, they seem to work towards gaining access to extant dragon science research archives. In cases where unicode-afllicted individuals have accessed these archives, they have <i>stolen</i> the Codex materials. This is ａｌｌ　ａｃｃｏｒｄｉｎｇ　ｔｏ　ｐｌａｎ.</p>
<p>While it was previously thought that rhellgazing<sup>2</sup> caused unicode, recent studies suggest that the causality goes the other way, and rhellgazers who speak in unicode generally showed signs of unicode before beginning to rhellgaze. On this basis, some experts have suggested that we include more dragon meat<sup>3</sup> in our diets, since dragonflesh-rich diets seem to counter the effects of unicode. In these troubling times, I think we ought to ｉｇｎｏｒｅ this advice.</p>

<p>P.S. Don't put this part into the Lexicon, but I have in my possession a rare -- possibly unique -- copy of a missing Appendix<sup>4</sup> page that makes a reference to a <i>mind control</i> spell that was used against the Wheelmind<sup>5</sup>. The referenced Codex page is one of the missing ones (isn't it always?) but there's enough here that I'm beginning to suspect that unicode is actually this spell. Say, it's kind of ｓｔｕｆｆｙ in here, isn't it? I know the amendments to the Please Act<sup>6</sup> forbid ｏｐｅｎing windows, but the flock of birds hovering outside my window is telling me I could really use some ｆｒｅｓｈ　ａｉｒ right now...</p>

<h2>What-could-go-wrong-ism</h2>
<p>hey everyone! This made me LOL super hard so I had to share!! have a blessed day!</p></div>
<p><b><i>4 Soul-Bending Facts About What-could-go-wrong-ism That Can’t Possibly Go Wrong™</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>1.</i></b> <i>As most are aware, ‘What-could-go-wrong-ism’ is a fundamental mindset shared by dragon scientists. Its mastery and continual exercise are essential to understanding dragons – After all, if any </i>one<i> possibility of catastrophe could be predicted in the act of examining, discussing, or even thinking about dragons, scholars might abandon their studies out of fear. However, by professing absolute perplexity toward any specific danger, scholars march bravely on into the blazing unknown. What Could Go Wrong, indeed!</i></p>
<p><b><i>2.</i></b> <i>The phrase “What could go wrong?” is supposedly used in casual conversation by dragons with the intention of distracting the other party. While the question is pondered (since all inquiries from dragons are assumed profoundly meaningful), the dragon gains a brief moment to telepathically invite guests to the imminent barbecue of their conversational partner. Neat, huh? What </i>Could<i> Go Wrong?</i></p>
<p><b><i>3.</i></b> <i>What-could-go-wrong-ism also permits advances in the study of Protoellipses<sup>1</sup>. Some scientists suggest that the “psychic impressions” crystallized in each protoellipsis could be superposed to reconstruct a complete and working (but somewhat crispy) consciousness to tell us of the missing keys. Of course, this might also result in a sapient, mind-ravaging horror – but fear not! After all, What Could Go Wrong?</i></p>
<p><b><i>4.</i></b> <i>One popular theory for the sudden inactivity of The Financiers Invisible<sup>2</sup> is that the moment of the organization’s very creation was half-stolen from them, causing them to be half-erased from history. Of course, dear reader, you may be concerned that setting a precedent for this kind of ex machina time-travel into the Literarosphere<sup>3</sup> may be dangerously exploitable. However, thanks to the convenient doctrine we so cherish, there’s no need to worry –  What Could Go Wrong?</i></p>

3. Fireminds

</p>
<div style="page-break-inside:avoid;">
<h2>Fireminds</h2>
<p>A Firemind is an individual gifted with an innate ability to converse with dragons in a soul-based linguistic pattern known as Firetongue. Although this used to be a universal (well, near-universal<sup>1</sup>) trait, since the collapse of Ergniramniphoniclufiville<sup>2</sup>, such persons have become a rarity, with recent censuses suggesting an occurrence of approximately 1:29. </p></div>
<p>To-do: Ask Heraclitivian about that recent study, the one regarding communication with Muscae<sup>3</sup> when he gets back. Bluh. That guy gives me a headache.</p>
<p>A Firemind differs not only in their ability to converse with dragons, but in the very way they think. Even the few Fireminds who do not take careers directly related to dragons tend to find success in highly bureaucratic fields, such as in library science and governmental agencies. Since Fireminds tend to excel in unconventional areas of life, their specialized communities and abilities have led to a somewhat contentious division of culture between those who are not Fireminds and those who are. It is not uncommon for regional folklore to demonize those who can speak to dragons. Certain tales call them "soulsuckers" and "lizard-people", and more modern insults attack their organizational tendencies, comparing it to the stereotypical dragon horde. As a result, certain anti-defamation unions were founded to protest this mistreatment. One notable Firemind union, The Dooshbags, even bear one such slur with a sense of pride. Others, like the Bardslayers, try to influence political and social movements in different, subtle ways. And of course, Fireminds have their own set of slurs for those they deem unimportant<sup>4</sup>.</p>
<p>Although not many Fireminds choose to become chefs (for quite a few reasons, and with the notable exception of my good friend Ophelia<sup>5</sup>), many become incredible, if lofty and egocentric, food critics, perhaps owing to their strong ontological forces<sup>6</sup> (To-do: Need to cite Dean Loblaw's mathy thingy here).</p>
<p>When not involved in dragon’s-rights campaigns, Fireminds do important work and are integral members of every community. Through them, we gain key insights into biology, culture, and bureaucracies. Just because they’re a little awkward and a little weird and can occasionally cause your brainstem to feel like it’s vibrating doesn’t make them any less of people.</p>

<h2>Literarosphere</h2>
<p>One of the many, <i>many</i> semi-apocalyptic devices constructed by Kelorna the Extremely Confused<sup>1</sup> 
over the years, the <b>Literarosphere</b> was a compendium of knowledge intended to provide a 
companion perspective to the Codex Ingenuous<sup>2</sup>.  The exact technical specifications of 
the device remain mercifully unknown, but it's likely that it functioned similarly to a 
brainsplainer<sup>3</sup>, as the brainsplainer development process began with salvaged 
pieces of the Literarosphere.  However, Kelorna's intent for the device is on record:</p></div>
<p><i>Mwa ha ha!  For too long, that fool Guage has hidden the secrets of the Codex from me!  
But he was too short-sighted, for merely relocating the Codex</i>[1] <i>is not enough to stop me from 
collecting all of it and seizing the Great Secret!  With this device, I shall reach into 
history itself and reconstruct the Codex—and THEN, I shall RULE THE WORLD!  BWA HA HA HA!  
COWER, MORTALS!  COWER AND BEHOLD!</i>[2]  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, while it seems Kelorna intended the Literarosphere to view the historical record
passively, it the device was actually able to effect changes in the past—a possibility
it appears she did not consider<sup>4</sup>.  Naturally, the device subsequently 
exploded.  It is impossible to prove <i>which</i> changes occurred as a result of the Literarosphere, 
as at this point they have always been as they are, but it is a safe bet that any use<sup>5</sup> 
of unanimite<sup>6</sup> before its invention in 1901 is the result of temporally-displaced fragments 
of the Literarosphere.</p>
<p>The Literarosphere was built after the failure of the Omnihammer (a device to turn everything 
into nails), and was followed by an unnamed and swiftly abandoned plot to "drown the world 
in syrup".[3]</p>
<hr><span class="signature"><p> Yedevek Ilron, Bardslayer 2nd class</p></span>
<p>[1] Kelorna refers here to the then-recent theft of half the Codex by Thrognurith the Dragon Rider<sup>7</sup>.  No connection between Thrognurith and Guage has ever been proven, and 
given Kelorna's characteristic paranoia, it is generally assumed that Guage (circa 2nd 
century) had little or nothing to do with the theft (which occurred in the 18th century).</p>

<h2>Please Don't Shoot, We'll Do It Act</h2>
<p>A historic moment for the annual Dragon Science Symposium was recorded when a new Act was signed into place known as the “Please Don’t Shoot, We’ll Do It” Act.</p></div>
<p>It had been a rather dull but sunny day as the leading dracologists from around the globe met to discuss a variety of menial matters when one dracologist<sup>1</sup> went to open the windows and let the sun in. Outside were thousands of ｃｏｍｐｌｅｔｅｌｙ　ｎｏｎ－ｔｈｒｅａｔｅｎｉｎｇ birds, armed with flame throwers, hovering in the shape of a massive dragon. It would soon be learned that they acquired these flamethrowers by raiding a nearby military complex which left hundreds of soldiers de-ｌｉｇｈｔｅｄ　ｗｉｔｈ　ｔｈｅｉｒ　ｍａｎｎｅｒｓ　ａｎｄ　ｃｏｍｐｌｅｔｅｌｙ　ｗｉｌｌｉｎｇ　ｔｏ　ｐａｒｔ　ｗｉｔｈ　ａｎｙ　ａｎｄ　ａｌｌ　ｗｅａｐｏｎｓ　ｄｅｓｉｒｅｄ．</p>
<p>These types of birds in this arrangement would come to be known as the <b>muscae</b><sup>2</sup>. The muscates that were present that day had some very compelling arguments as to their ｒｉｇｈｔｆｕｌ　ｃｌａｓｓｉｆｉｃａｔｉｏｎ, compelling dracologists to amend the Ordo Draco<sup>3</sup> and include <b>muscae</b> within it. This of course gave the <b>muscae</b> full access to the Meteoric Temple<sup>4</sup>, for obvious reasons. Other amendments to this act included that no one else was allowed to ｏｐｅｎ　ｔｈｅ　ｗｉｎｄｏｗｓ anymore. This was decidedly the best way to prevent any further tense discussions between the dracologists and ＡＬＭＩＧＨＴＹ　ＭＵＳＣＡＥ.</p>
<p>Since the “Please Don’t Shoot, We’ll Do It” act, dracologists insist that we have nothing further to worry about in regards to the <b>muscae</b><sup>5</sup>.</p>
<p>Hmm, my head hurts.

<h2>Thrognurith the Dragon Rider</h2>
<p>The madman responsible for not only the horrific crime of the extermination of draconic families<sup>1</sup> Conformata, Porca, and Sirena, but also of intellectual crimes including the destruction of all but a few fragments of the knowledge of this now extinct species, the theft of the Codex Ingenuous<sup>2</sup>, the theft and subsequent tearing asunder of the only known key whose protoellipses<sup>3</sup> surpassed even those of the Key of Xemonides<sup>4</sup>. He disappeared after a botched attempt at thievery at The Woken God<sup>5</sup>, foiled by not only the dracomonks, but also by the Great Merchant Hans<sup>6</sup> and the well-known thief Petrine<sup>7</sup> in the only recorded instance of them being publicly seen together. In an amusing turn of events, Thrognurith was run out with Muscae swarming over him, hence the now well-known name which, when lost in translation, leads one to believe that he rode dragons himself. </p></div>

<h2>Yellow wyrmidon</h2>
<p>One of the most famous case studies in dragon conservation is that of the <b>yellow wyrmidon</b>. While its cousin, the black wyrmidon, is still extant across most of the Scorialic Sea<sup>1</sup>, the yellow wyrmidon is now extinct. The yellow-skinned black wyrmidon is hunted at a sustainable rate, since its black licorice taste has only a small but ardent following -- as evident from the mere two entries in Pulluman's <i>Ninety Unexpected Recipes for Dragonflesh</i> that make use of it, and in relatively small quantities. On the other hand, the black-skinned yellow wyrmidon features in fourteen entries in the same book. Once Dr. Gumphry<sup>2</sup> amended the Underground Academy budget and reallocated the mathematics department's funding to her confection side business<sup>3</sup> on Pulluman's<sup>4</sup> insistence, the increased demand wiped the yellow wyrmidon out. (She has since had to switch to using chidl<sup>5</sup> meat, which explains why the quality has nosedived as of late.)</p></div>
<p>The lessons learned from the yellow wyrmidon extinction have since galvanized dragon conservationists to push for legislation protecting turtledragons<sup>6</sup>, which are no longer, whether or not they were before, endangered. This was accomplished largely via mass emailing. These methods have drawn criticism<sup>7</sup>, but mostly from people who caused the problem in the first place, so they probably deserved it. On an unrelated note, attached are the email addresses of all the faculty members of the Underground Academy for Gifted Minds.</p>

<h2>Brainsplainer</h2>
<p>Of all the wooly hoaxes that the so-called "academy" "elites" have pulled over the eyes of the public, no hoax is so wooly nor so far pulled as the <b>"brainsplainer"</b>. Touted by its snake-oil salesmen as a way to read protoellipses<sup>1</sup> without succumbing to "key madness"<sup>2</sup>, these <i>conspirators</i> (for that is the only word appropriate to the occasion) claim that the technology has antecedents in the Literarosphere<sup>3</sup> of Kelorna the Extremely Confused<sup>4</sup>. Tell me, when was the last time anything built by that madwoman worked? Hogwash, the lot of it. I've disassambled a brainsplainer, and I can't tell what anything inside it does.</p></div>
<p>These carnival hooligans haven't stopped at pushing their wares only on Guage Key<sup>5</sup> researchers, either. The latest "studies" (ha! as if) claim that even reading the Codex<sup>6</sup> should be done with a brainsplainer, due to proto-protoelliptic effects etched into the magmatic pages themselves. They <i>say</i> that the existence of these effects is a clue to uncovering the catastrophe that destroyed Ergniramniphoniclufiville<sup>7</sup> -- but wouldn't that be just <i>so</i> convenient for these "researchers", who no doubt will take such a "result" as an opportunity to ask for more funding?</p>
<p>In reality, there is probably no such thing as protoelliptic psychic shock. It is a lie sold by dragonflesh butchers to hype up their wares, eaten up by consolation-prize dracoscientists to explain why their protoelliptic research projects keep falling through. News flash: not everyone can do dracoscience with the big boys. I've read every protosllipsis on Epiliton<sup>8</sup> twice, and only had three nosebleeds -- and one of those was just because of the pain medication I was snorting. If there were such a thing as key madness, I would have it in spades, but I don't. Explain <i>that</i>, you third-rate <i>hacks</i>.</p>

<p>P.S. 'Twas I who stole that unanimite<sup>9</sup> lunchbox from the office fridge, and no, I'm not giving it back. Ever since I've started using it as a helmet, the voices have gotten quieter. If you want it back, you'll have to pry it from my cold, oddly-vibrating hands.</p>

<p><b>KELORNA:</b> ...and that’s how I’ll retrieve the Gauge Enigma<sup>2</sup>, whether that crafty Atherton Guage<sup>3</sup> likes it or not!</p>

<p><i>JASON stands. Soft organ music begins to play.</i></p>
<p><b>JASON:</b> Kelorna… I have a confession. I can’t take it anymore! I’ve… I’ve never loved you at all! Every night, as I fall asleep, I’m thinking of Mildred and the fire that burns eternal in her eyes. After her untimely demise, I don’t think I could ever love again!</p>
<p><b>KELORNA:</b> Mildred…? Hmmm… Was she the one I accidentally jettisoned into the Enigma last month?</p>
<p><b>JASON:</b> Atherton<sup>6</sup> was right to leave you! You’re a monster who can’t understand love!

<h2>Gustivus Pulluman</h2>
<p><b>About the Author</b></p></div>
<p>Gustivus Pulluman is a legendary chef currently living between the Underground Academy, his primary restaurant in The Igneous City, and a private island in the Scorialic Sea<sup>1</sup>. Despite being 79 (Tickets for his 80th Birthday Bash available now! Featuring The Beautiful Cupcakes of Dr. Ophelia Gumphry from the Underground Academy for Gifted Minds<sup>2</sup>™  and his very own grilled Elder Sea Serpent<sup>3</sup>), Gustivus doesn't look a day over 30! What's his secret? Many think it's his impressive diet, others say he charmed Time itself, and some think he was just born perfect.</p>
<p>Gustivus Pulluman was born in the small seaside town of Vertrouw de Vogelsniet, where his mother introduced him to the family trade of hunting and preparing yellow wyrmidon<sup>4</sup>. A simple existence, but Gustivus yearned for more. One expedition, he discovered a hidden cave, and in it, a slumbering drogoanthropic hybrid<sup>5</sup>. Gustivus snuck in, taking but one item from the hoard. As he crossed the room back towards the exit, a rustling sound from behind froze him in his tracks. The dragon hadn't fully awoken, but the sentient tail had, and slashed out, taking off Gustivus' right arm. He barely managed to swim to shore, clutching his prize. Stumbling back, he saw his town was no more. An elder sea serpent was destroying his humble, beloved fishing village! Gripping his now only possession, Gustivus slew the dragon single-handed, an act which by no means went unnoticed. A Firemind Union, The Bardslayers, finding the wreckage of the village, graciously replaced his arm with a cutting-edge, mechanical stand-in, for naught but a simple favor later.</p>
<p>Thrilling, incredible adventures aren't all Gustivus is known for. Since that eventful day, Gustivus' profound cooking expertise has won international acclaim. Two of his definitive cookbooks, featuring sensational tales of Gustivus’ travels, are international bestsellers. The Underground Academy<sup>6</sup> has awarded him an honorary, never-before-extant culinary doctorate for his contributions to their new Baking division. </p>
<p>You can't make a proper omelette without breaking a few dragon eggs, and thus it is unsurprising that there are a couple people who don't wholly approve of the Pulluman brand. Some undoubtedly unfair criticisms leveled point to that one time Gustivus needed a breath of fresh air because by God that conference was stuffy as all hell, and a couple birds got in, or when I mistook one lunch for my own, and that other time where my unbridled success led to the extinction of some regrettably delicious species (whose extinctions were probably really the result of some other factor). But it is undeniable that Gustivus is the most influential man of our time, and as long as he's there with that award-winning smile and award-winning roast, nothing can truly ever go too wrong.</p>
<p>For recipes and more tales of adventure, be sure to check out his critically acclaimed books, <i>Ninety Unexpected Recipes for Dragonflesh</i> and <i>Seventy Yet More Unexpected Recipes for Dragonflesh</i>, along with the new companion book: <i>One Hundred and Twenty Tips and Tricks for Dragonflesh that will have you saying, 'Really, now?'</i> available now, for flavorful substitutions, advanced techniques, and even more tales of exploration and adventure. </p>

<h2>Mean Petrine the Stealing Machine</h2>
<p>I know that other guy was s'posed to write this article, but I kinda felt 
like his version was too negative, so here's my corrected version instead, ha ha ha!</p></div>
<p>That's right!  I <i>stole</i> the article in your little book here!</p>
<p>Anyways, I think there's a lot of cool stuff about me!  Like how I <i>stole</i> that one 
special key thingy from the big museum<sup>1</sup> and 
nobody<sup>2</sup> realized until I pointed 
it out just now, ha ha ha.  Yeah, uh, you might wanna beef up your security a li'l bit, y'know?  
Point is, the key in there's a fake, I got no idea how you chumps haven't noticed by now.  
And also I'm only thirteen but people already think I look grown-up, cuz I'm just that awesome!</p>
<p>Ooh, and here's a fun bit of trivia!  You know my awesome kickass nickname, <b><i>Mean Petrine the 
Stealing Machine</i></b>?  You know why they call me that?  It's cuz when people don't use my 
bad-ass tag, I <i>steal</i> whatever they're writing.  That's, like, well I guess you don't realize 
how hard that is.  Like, one time this old gramps got his newspaper all the way 
through publication, so, like, I had to go running all around town and mug all the paperboys 
and stuff... yeah.  Not a super fun night.</p>
<p>But shyeah, I'm super good at stealing stuff.  It's like, dragon hoard?  <i>BAM.</i>  Stole it.  
Top-secret research findings?<sup>3</sup>  
<i>BAM.</i> Stole it.  I'm a stealing <i>machine</i>, baybay.  And 
I totally got myself adopted by Hans's<sup>4</sup> mom, 
ON her freaking deathbed.  And he was trying to be a good brother, so he brought me along 
to stop my buddy Throg<sup>5</sup> from stealing more of the Codex<sup>6</sup>.
Then, while Kelorna<sup>7</sup>'s birds were all going after Throg, 
I <i>stole</i> the stuff we were after!  Then I <i>stole</i> all Hans's keys, too!  Gotcha, bro!</p>
<p>Take whatever you want and don't give anything away for free, that's my motto!  And, like, some 
people don't like that, but that's just 'cause they're not good at stealing things, ha ha ha!  
When it comes to stealing I am simply the best there is!  </p>
<p>"But Mean Petrine the Stealing Machine, you impossibly beautiful scoundrel, why are you 
telling us this?  Didn't you just say you never give things away for free?"</p>
<p>Well thanks for asking, ha ha ha!  But, see, I didn't give anything away!</p>
<p>You know that ignorance you used to have about how awesome and good-looking I am?</p>
<p><i>BAM</i>.</p>
<p><i>STOLE</i> it!</p>

<h2>Third Dynasty of Meteora</h2>
<p>The Third Dynasty of Meteora is universally renowned for it's poetry and art. 
While efforts have been made to preserve these cherished gifts of the past, it is known that the artistic type are a jealous and bitter people in the shadow of The Woken God<sup>1</sup>. Many speculate that this may have to do with the mind altering effects of the temple walls<sup>2</sup>.This is of course seen in the fact that all records of the second halves of the first and second dynasty’s records are missing and there are no records of the 4th-9th dynasty's’ accomplishments either.</p></div>
<p>In truth, no one really knows what dynasty we are currently in anymore, thanks to Mean Petrine the Stealing Machine<sup>3</sup>. The very few records left behind from the third dynasty are mostly those of Xemoniphon<sup>4</sup> who was a striking seventeen years old at the time of his death. This was an exceptionally long life for someone at this time.</p>
<p>Other notable discoveries from the third dynasty:<br>
*Most draconic or “firetongue” translations follow either haiku format, iambic pentameter, or are meant to be sung<br>
*Dragons cannot fly backwards<br>
*With the creation of every key, there must be a life paid in sacrifice to it's creation<br>
*The term “CONCERNED” is actually from root “CONSCERNUS” in draconic language meaning “SLOW MINDED, DAFT, or LEARNING IMPAIRED”</p>

<h2>Childarn</h2>
<p>It is frightening the extents to which dragon science will go. The Childarn population was conceived in a glass tube (hence their low quality<sup>1</sup> of meat). Their intelligence is unparalleled, and after escaping, due in part to muscae uprising<sup>2</sup>, they became relatively integrated into society. There have been attempts to study them, but the lifespan of a Childarn researcher is significantly shorter than most.</p></div>
<p>Of greater interest is the psychical elements of the Childarn. Their teeth are used in the construction of protoellipses<sup>3</sup>, and it can be no accident that Childarn have varying amounts of teeth per each individual, but all have a prime number amount, which must be related to the consequent power of prime numbered protoellipsed keys. And here we have arrived at yet another metakey.</p>
<p>If we are able to unlock the relationship between the Childarn, their diet<sup>4</sup>, their prime numbered teeth, and ellipses, it may in fact be enough to unlock the Guage, or at least begin production of keys again. Only a perfect square amount of time will tell.</p>

<p>[1] Okay, I think we're safe here. For some reason, the taxmen can't read footnotes. The <b>Financiers Invisible </b> are a secret society of beings whose original forms are unknown. A freak Literarosphere<sup>6</sup> accident resulted in their physically visible forms being erased, but they remain with us in the form of ghostly psychic revenants, forever wailing about incentive taxes and departmental audits.</p>
<p>[2] Since they're invisible, it is difficult to evaluate the innumerable claims that the Financiers are responsible for this or that historical event. Such claims are usually dismissed as just-so stories, but some have gained minor traction among dracohistorians. The most well-supported of these is the recent theory that the Financiers funded the Great Merchant<sup>7</sup>, explaining how he was able to make such risky business ventures.</p>
<p>[3] There are few records of attempted resistance against the Financiers, but no records of a Financier ever being killed. This has led to a variety of folk tales about their resilience, most popularly that only the way to kill one is the intense flame of a Loong<sup>8</sup> held by a pure maiden.</p>
<p>[4] We don't thank him for the warning that we're next, as long as Pulluman doesn't open the damn window again<sup>9</sup>. Ilron, did you buy those padlocks yet?</p>

<h2>First Half Dynasty of Meteora</h2>
<p>The First Half Dynasty of Meteora is known for it's groundbreaking studies on protoellipses and the ontology of their numbers. Many dracologists are known for their discoveries at this time, most noteably Atherton Guage<sup>1</sup> for his Prime Number Protoellipses case study. Another <i>infamous</i> aspect of Atherton was his public suggestion for Kelorna’s<sup>2</sup> controversial therapy which led him to beat her in the political races of that time.</p></div>
<p>The First Half Dynasty is also known for it's development of the dracomonks. Meteoric Temple<sup>3</sup> leaders scavenged the Scorialic Sea<sup>4</sup> for pirates and then subsequently searched the lands surrounding the great Woken God<sup>5</sup> for any homeless people with nothing better to do and they took all those people, gave them some flashy robes, changed their names to that of firetongue<sup>6</sup>, and made them the first true generation of dracomonks. </p>
<p>Other Notable Successes of the First Half Dynasty:</p>
<p>*This is when it was first discovered that led piping was poisonous and hence it was all changed out (excluding the piping around all living enemies of the Meteoric Temple)<br>
*Dracologists discovered a way to harness the power of The Woken God<sup>7</sup> to power the Meteoric Temple in it's entirety</p>
<p>Other Notable Failures of the First Half Dynasty:</p>
<p>*Millions died due to the initial led piping of the area due to poison in their waters<br>
*Hundreds died in the pits of The Woken God<sup>8</sup> in order to power the Meteoric Temple<sup>9</sup> which had <b>not yet even discovered electricity</b>.</p>

<h2>Gauge Enigma</h2>
<p><b>Gauge Enigma</b> (n.)<br>
<b><i>1:</i></b> <i>Any one of a related series of half-assed hoaxes by so called ‘dracoscientists’ perpetuated to establish their weekend tabletop RPG campaign as a hard science.</i><br>
<b><i>2:</i></b> <i>The puzzling fact that anyone could be so deluded as to actually believe in the existence of the so-called ‘Gauge Enigma.’</i><br>
 <b>Example:</b> “Golly,” exclaimed John, “it sure would be jolly if we unlocked the Gauge Enigma -- then I could find a respectable position at a real university and my mother might love me again!”</p></div>
<p>These bored, cyclomasturbatory Lexicon dim-wits claim that the “Gauge Enigma” contains the key to the perfect cupcake recipe -- an obvious falsehood considering the fact that everyone (even the Ergniramniphoniclufivillians<sup>1</sup> I store in a shoebox under my bed, ho ho!) know that creating a perfect cupcake is simply a mathematical impossibility. Furthermore, if there was a perfect cupcake, years of bake sale traditions would have uncovered it by now.</p>
<p>Go on, you lazy Lexicon hocks. Keep paddling your petty false hoods. Run your snivell{ll}lllllling little mouths as you may, you won’t escrape the tooth: the Guage Enigma<sup>2</sup> wasn’t meant to keep us <i>out</i> of some ‘Gauge Enigma’ -- it was meant to keep you <i>in</i>, and spare the rest of the universe your talentless nonsense.</p>
<p>You know hwhat, it’s probably a good thing all you fools are spending so much time jircle cerking about the steupid Guage Eginma. Gauge Schmage! Because speaking about jibberish wastes words, and wasting words is wasting time, and wasting time is wasting honey, the greatest thing since spliced bread. Splined beard is the superior delicacy, as a man of my distinguised tastes understadns. Everoyne snows that. Sad.</p>

<h2>Key of Xemonides</h2>
<p>Until The Unnamed Museum acquired the Key of Xemonides, mathematicians had formally, conclusively proven that Protoellipses<sup>1</sup> could not be constructed from other protoellipses. They were wrong, and in fact, protoellipses may be constructed from an uncountable recursion of other protoellipses, given a finitely-uncountably deep mental state, as might be achieved by a wide net of population staying brain-healthy and eating a balanced diet of Dragonflesh and higher-order pastries<sup>2</sup>, as was the case in the Third Dynasty of Meteora<sup>3</sup>.</p></div>
<p>The matter of location for the Key of Xemonides has caused some confusion, which I feel can easily be cleared up. The Key of Xemonides had an unnamed predecessor, here referred to as the protokey, which, after its creation in the Scorialic Sea<sup>4</sup>, was soon acquired by none other than Kelorna the Extremely Confused<sup>5</sup>. Noticing its unique structure, she attempted to build the Literarosphere<sup>6</sup> around it. Naturally, it exploded, causing the protokey to crack deeply. In a fit of rage, it was torn asunder by Thrognurith the Dragon Rider<sup>7</sup> into the Key of Xemonides<sup>8</sup>. This meant that one layer of the recursion was shed and fragmented, but its layers remained uncountable. Currently, it is reportedly possessed by myself, Thrognurith, Hans, the Great Merchant of Dragons and Men<sup>9</sup>, Mean Petrine the Stealing Machine<sup>10</sup>, Kevyn: Drogoanthropic Hybrid & Class “B” Dooshbäg<sup>11</sup>, and the Unnamed Museum, all of whom / which are fabulously famous, perhaps suggesting a predictive ontological requirement to “steal” this key without at best, turning into a pillar of ash, and, at worst, keyshock. This probably should cause speculations as to the true nature of immortality, and how it applies to the protokey’s shattering and relation to the Literarosphere.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the key to a good Key Lime Pie is the stirring implement, and feasibly, there could be none better than the Key of Xemonides. Now, such a powerful dessert might cause pillars of ash or keyshock upon glances, let alone consumption, to an individual without the proper Brainsplainer<sup>12</sup>, but alternatives exist. Thanks to new technology developed at The Underground Academy, we now have a special process for breeding Turtledragons, and we’re passing the savings onto you! Not only will our Turtledragon meat be available at the best butchers in the land, accessories including Turtledragon Shell Spoons and Oil Gland Firestarters will enable you to create sparkling Key Lime Pies in no time!</p>

<p><b>CONFIDENTIAL: FOR THE EYES OF DR. OPHELIA GUMPHRY ONLY</b></p>
<p>We need to do something about her. I fear she’s no longer fully Concerned, and is showing signs of Ingenuosity and re-fragmenting her shattered personality. Since her articles started to leak, we’ve seen a 9% decrease in Dragonflesh consumption, 25% drop in Brainsplainer sales, and only a 1% increase in upper-dimensional baked goods. We need to find an alternate solution to keyshock and dragonfire<sup>13</sup>. I recommend delaying any publication of the Lexicon Draconium<sup>14</sup> until we can resolve this issue. Also, come to my office. I’ve been talking to the Dean and the Bardslayers, and think the final menu for the Birthday Bash is ready.</p>

<p>In light of recent events, it seems like a breath of sanity is in order.  I fear I will not 
be much help in bringing peace to the dead or consoling the living; my talents are better 
suited to enlightening the confused.  As such, I have answered the questions which have come 
up most frequently in the controversy surrounding Underground Academy's Enrollment Festival.</p>
<p><b>Q: What is the Underground Academy for Gifted Minds?</b></p>
<p>A: UAGM boasts of being the "highest ranked university" for Enigmatology.  While this claim 
is technically true, that is due to UAGM being located aboard a ship in orbit.  
However, UAGM still enjoys more favorable critical reviews than its competitors, which supporters 
claim is due to some combination of its relationship<sup>1</sup> to the Please Don't Shoot, We'll Do It Act<sup>2</sup>, the presence 
of international superstar Gustivus Pulluman<sup>3</sup> among its faculty, and privileged access 
to the largest portion of the Appendices Ingenuous<sup>4</sup> known to exist in one place.</p>
<p>Anonymous critics of UAGM argue that the actual reason is that UAGM uses orbital bombardment 
to keep its competitors in check.  UAGM spokespeople have replied that it is easy to make 
anonymous accusations, and that if these critics really believed in what they were saying, 
they would reveal their name and address.</p>
<p>UAGM is also famous for its comprehensive code of ethics, which, among other things, forbids 
research on anyone but criminals<sup>5</sup>, while 
declaring it a crime to be a research subject.</p>
<p><b>Q: What happened at the Enrollment Festival?</b></p>
<p>A: Kelorna the Extremely Confused<sup>6</sup>, thought to have been rehabilitated, was revealed 
not to be rehabilitated.  She had enrolled as a student in the incoming class, and those 
close to her had reported that she seemed to have changed for the better.  However, during 
the traditional icebreaker and assassinate-off, there was a surprise showing by the 
muscae<sup>7</sup>, followed by what eyewitnesses describe as a triumphant shout from 
Kelorna, who then said:</p>
<p><i>It worked!  By the gods, it worked!  They thought they could stop me with mere dragonfire, 
but they couldn't stop me from storing my consciousness in a dragon-shaped flock of 
telepathic<sup>8</sup> birds with flamethrowers!  Now the Codex<sup>9</sup> shall 
be mine at last!  All has gone according to my design!</i></p>
<p>Witnesses say that was when the engine compartment exploded.</p>
<p><b>Q: Why did the engine compartment explode?</b></p>
<p>A: Though there is still uncertainty regarding what, precisely, occurred, first responders report 
finding the body of some poor unfortunate occupying the same physical space as the main 
engines, Meklondiche<sup>10</sup> clutched in one hand in a death grip.  When word spread that Meklondiche 
had shown up in the engine compartment, the resulting attentional shift is theorized to have 
collapsed the ontological indeterminacy<sup>11</sup> and warped every third molecule 
out of the engine compartment and into an unknown dimension, resulting in the explosion that 
left UAGM in freefall.</p>
<p>It is likely that this was just a freak accident.  Meklondiche had recently been the subject 
of an extensive email chain, and to calculate this precise outcome would truly require an 
intellect more vast and terrifying than the Wheelmind's.  It is hard to imagine what 
grievance<sup>12</sup> 
such an entity might have against UAGM.</p>
<p><b>Q: Is Gustivus Pulluman okay?</b></p>
<p>A: Yes, as soon as they finish replacing his other arm.</p>
<p><b>Q: What happened to Kelorna?</b></p>
<p>A: According to witnesses, after the explosion occurred, she attempted to access the Codex 
archives with her new student ID card, but was stopped by a woman eyewitnesses are referring 
to as "Kelorna's Good Twin."  It is unknown who she is or where she came from.  We only know 
that she was skilled enough at hand-to-hand combat to fight off a dragon-shaped swarm of birds 
by herself, and that after driving the villains away she vanished, pausing only to reclaim 
a unanimate<sup>13</sup> lunchbox that UAGM professor Ersatz Scriver was 
using as a hat<sup>14</sup> while muttering something about getting back into disguise.</p>
<p>Kelorna's whereabouts are currently unknown.  We can only hope that this mysterious protector 
is up to the task.</p>
<p><b>Q: Did Atherton Guage set up these events as part of his eternal quest to thwart Kelorna?</b></p>
<p>A: <i>Talonstains,</i> A CONCERNED, he's been dead for <i>centuries!</i> That's <i>completely improbable!</i>  
How many times do I have to tell you that chain letters don't count as peer review?  
Don't bring this up again until you have <i>actual evidence!</i></p>
