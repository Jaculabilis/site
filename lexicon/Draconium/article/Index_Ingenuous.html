<div class="contentblock"><h1>Index Ingenuous</h1><p>Contemporary dragon science could never have reached the heights it has if it were not for the organizational clarity provided by the <b>Index Ingenuous</b>. While the molten pages of the Codex itslf provide the basis on which all of dragon science is founded, the elaborations of the <a  href="Appendices_Ingenuous.html">Appendices Ingenuous</a> encompass more material than is possible to learn in a human lifetime. It is only through the grand ambitions of the Index that this wealth of material can be made accessible to mortals such as ourselves.</p>
<p>It is a constant lament of dragon scientists, therefore, that the original Index is missing. Approximately seventy percent of the Index is extant in scans and copies across all professional research teams, and it is suspected that anywhere from two to ten percent of the remaining may be known to private individuals. It is a matter of public record that this unfortunate circumstance is the fault of that dastardly criminal, <a  href="Mean_Petrine_the_Stealing_Machine.html">Mean Petrine the Stealing Machine</a> -- or would be, at any rate, if she hadn't stolen the public records of the incident.</p>
<p>The Index itself is divided into an index proper of significant terms and concepts, a glossary (the shortest section), and a concordance (by far the largest). Nearly half of the glossary is missing from the shared pool of recovered Index pages, as well as some of the most important sections of the concordance.</p>
