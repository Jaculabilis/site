<h1>Mean Petrine the Stealing Machine</h1>
<p>I know that other guy was s'posed to write this article, but I kinda felt 
like his version was too negative, so here's my corrected version instead, ha ha ha!</p>
<p>That's right!  I <i>stole</i> the article in your little book here!</p>
<p>Anyways, I think there's a lot of cool stuff about me!  Like how I <i>stole</i> <a href="Key_of_Xemonides.html">that one 
special key thingy from the big museum</a> and 
<a href="Kevyn3A_Drogoanthropic_Hybrid_26_Class_E2809CBE2809D_DooshbC3A4g.html">nobody</a> realized until I pointed 
it out just now, ha ha ha.  Yeah, uh, you might wanna beef up your security a li'l bit, y'know?  
Point is, the key in there's a fake, I got no idea how you chumps haven't noticed by now.  
And also I'm only thirteen but people already think I look grown-up, cuz I'm just that awesome!</p>
<p>Ooh, and here's a fun bit of trivia!  You know my awesome kickass nickname, <b><i>Mean Petrine the 
Stealing Machine</i></b>?  You know why they call me that?  It's cuz when people don't use my 
bad-ass tag, I <i>steal</i> whatever they're writing.  That's, like, well I guess you don't realize 
how hard that is.  Like, one time this old gramps got his newspaper all the way 
through publication, so, like, I had to go running all around town and mug all the paperboys 
and stuff... yeah.  Not a super fun night.</p>
<p>But shyeah, I'm super good at stealing stuff.  It's like, dragon hoard?  <i>BAM.</i>  Stole it.  
<a href="The_Educational_Exploitation_of_Dragon_Fire.html">Top-secret research findings?</a>  
<i>BAM.</i> Stole it.  I'm a stealing <i>machine</i>, baybay.  And 
I totally got myself adopted by <a href="Hans2C_the_Great_Merchant_of_Dragons_and_Men.html">Hans's</a> mom, 
ON her freaking deathbed.  And he was trying to be a good brother, so he brought me along 
to stop my buddy <a href="Thrognurith_the_Dragon_Rider.html">Throg</a> from stealing more of the <a href="Codex_Ingenuous.html">Codex</a>.
Then, while <a href="Kelorna_the_Extremely_Confused.html">Kelorna</a>'s birds were all going after Throg, 
I <i>stole</i> the stuff we were after!  Then I <i>stole</i> all Hans's keys, too!  Gotcha, bro!</p>
<p>Take whatever you want and don't give anything away for free, that's my motto!  And, like, some 
people don't like that, but that's just 'cause they're not good at stealing things, ha ha ha!  
When it comes to stealing I am simply the best there is!  </p>
<p>"But Mean Petrine the Stealing Machine, you impossibly beautiful scoundrel, why are you 
telling us this?  Didn't you just say you never give things away for free?"</p>
<p>Well thanks for asking, ha ha ha!  But, see, I didn't give anything away!</p>
<p>You know that ignorance you used to have about how awesome and good-looking I am?</p>
<p><i>BAM</i>.</p>
<p><i>STOLE</i> it!</p>
