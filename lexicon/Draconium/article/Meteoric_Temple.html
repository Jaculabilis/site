<div class="contentblock"><h1>Meteoric Temple</h1><p>Otherwise known as the Vaticant, this is the seat of power for the mighty dracomonks, but most importantly, it is where some of the most brilliant keys in history were produced. I have written extensively on the fourth set of one hundred keys, but the remarkable fact of the Meteoric Temple is that this ranks only third on the list of their most notable accomplishments. The <a  href="First_Half_Dynasty_of_Meteora.html">First Half Dynasty of Meteora</a> laid down not only the framework for the creation of a key, it conducted extensive studies on protoellipses and the <a  href="Ontological_cost.html">ontology</a> of their numbers. <a  href="Atherton_Guage.html">Atherton Guage</a> extensively studied the effects of prime numbers on a key at this site, and in so doing created key 14, or so the stories say. Key 14 is the first key[1]  to contain not only a prime amount of protoellipses, but a stunning quantity of 79, a feat that remained unsurpassed until the creation of Epiliton. </p>
<p>The location of the Meteoric Temple upon <a  href="The_Woken_God.html">The Woken God</a> assists with the forging and research of keys, though not without <a  href="Rhellgazing.html">risk</a>. The lava that constantly erupts upon it makes work hostile, but provides the necessary material and energy to conduct such important research.</p>
<p>Of a more minor note, some remarkable species of dragons may be found here, the <a  href="The_Educational_Exploitation_of_Dragon_Fire.html">biological study of which</a> has little to do with keys, which is surely a shame.</p>
