<div class="contentblock"><h1>Unanimite</h1><p>Dear Authors of the Lexicon,</p>
<p>It has come to my attention that the artisinally-crafted unanimite lunchbox I won from the raffle at last year’s Lexicon sweater party was stolen from the community refrigerator. I know that the thief must have taken it sometime in the last 3 day (4 day?) revolution of the Guage Enigma.</p>
<p>I will remind you that unanimite is <i>expensive</i>, having been created only in a small quantity by <a  href="Kelorna_the_Extremely_Confused.html">Kelorna</a> to turn excess “real world” heat energy quanta into meaningful development of the <a  href="Literarosphere.html">Literarosphere</a>. Of course, this has the delightful consequence of causing the box to maintain a permanent and comfortable thirty-six-point-eight degree temperature, but I wouldn’t expect a lunch-pilfering mongoloid such as yourself to have an appreciation for the metal’s finer technical merits. </p>
<p><a  href="Gustivus_Pulluman.html">Gustivus</a>, if this was you again, I swear to <a  href="The_Woken_God.html">God</a>, I’ll see to it personally that the fireminds replace your other arm too. While moxie is an excellent spice, it’s best served warm and untainted by property crime. I think your estranged culinary mentor would agree. Need a “brash” new idea? Don’t 👏 steal 👏 my 👏 lunch.</p>
<p>This is a transcendental and valuable artifact, and isn’t some inconsequential container you can take in and out of the refrigerator – it is my <i>lunchbox</i>, and I demand that whoever took it return it immediately. </p>
<p>Fie on you, filthy food thief! Don’t make me fix my caps lock key!</p>
