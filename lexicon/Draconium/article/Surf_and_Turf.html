<h1>Surf and Turf</h1>
<p><b>Surf and Turf</b> describes a wide variety of meals including meat elements from both seafood and some form of land-based meat. Popular choices for the seafood element may be lobster, giant rock crab, or salmon, while the “turf” can be anything from beef rib to dragonsteak. Certain, particularly skilled and artistic artists pair closely related meats, such as fatty sea wyrm cutlets and yellow dragon rib to show off subtle and expert handling in the art of comparison.</p>
<p>Surf and Turf, while a challenging meal, offers great reward to those who master it. Above all else, the versatility in choosing from infinite combinations and pairings mean that each preparation is filled with personality and artistic vision. The key is finding a unifying factor, and exploring the differences from there. Some food critics prefer the earthy, poultry flavor of cockatrice, complemented with the salty licorice strandiness of <a href="Elder_Sea_Serpent.html">Elder Sea Serpent</a>. <a href="Childarn.html">The small, confusing people</a>, on the other hand, may enjoy the simple, but effective, combination of shrimp and ground hydra in a burger or chili.</p>
<p>From the remaining portions of <a href="Index_Ingenuous.html">Index Ingenuous</a>, we know that dragonflesh operates differently than any other types of meat. Notably, for practical purposes, the muscles tend to grain in spurious and odd directions. While beefsteak and salmon should generally be cut against the grain, this presents a problem for preparing either aquatic or terrestrial dragon, but as with all problems in cooking, this simply offers more possibilities. One can try to find a major grain to cut against for tenderness, or slow-roast the meat, so it will flake anyways.</p>
