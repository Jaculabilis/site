<p>this gave me the goosebumps!!</p>
<p><i>I’m so unbearably sorry. I think I found it, but I need help. Please.</i></p>
<p><i>Two days ago, I left to search for it just a few miles north of the spires.
I found it. I found the damned thing in a tidy
spine of chryophite poking through the soot, peeking out like it 
</i>wanted<i> me to find it. In my excitement, I extracted it from the rock 
without a second thought. However, to my horror, I noticed that the 
<a  href="Protoellipses.html">protoellipses</a> were disastrously unbalanced, albeit only </i>after<i> I 
had broken it free. I should have checked first, but the <a  href="Codex_Ingenuous.html">Codex</a> never indicated that Meklondiche would have been one of the 
keys with an <a  href="Ontological_cost.html">ontological cost</a>. God, I wish I’d checked the 
protoellipses first. I’m so sorry.</i></p>
<p><i>Fearing for myself and for anything a few miles around me, I scrambled 
for my notes on the Codex, poring over them in the ash until there was 
no longer light to see, clutching the key as if my grip could keep it in 
this plane. Oddly, the key had not shown any signs of decreation. 
Feeling encouraged by this fact, I started to look for a place to sleep. 
Not a moment had my thoughts strayed when Meklondiche flickered and 
withered in my hand. I knew the cost immediately: attention. Meklondiche 
will remain only as long as you give it your thoughts.</i>
 
<i>I can’t sleep until somebody else feeds it – I fear that my dreams won’t be 
enough. I’m terrified to think what it might take with it were it to 
disappear. Please, forward this e-mail to as many people as you can. The 
more people think about the key, the safer we’ll all be.</i></p>
<p>send this to <b>no fewer than seven</b> distinguished scholars in the next 
hour… we can’t afford to lose another!!</p>
