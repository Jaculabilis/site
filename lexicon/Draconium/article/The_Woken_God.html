<div class="contentblock"><h1>The Woken God</h1><p>We mortals revere dragons for being larger, angrier, and more fiery than us.  We imagine 
that the dragons have no corresponding entity, but this is not true, because there are 
indeed entities larger, angrier, and more fiery than dragons: that is, volcanoes.  And none 
are larger, angrier, or more fiery than their holiest volcano: "<b>The Woken God</b>", or, as 
the dragons call it, "Woaorarglarghrargh".  (The usual caveats about draconic transliterations 
apply here.)</p>
<p>Writings about Woken God are, of course, highly intertwined with the history of the 
<a  href="Codex_Ingenuous.html">Codex Ingenuous</a>, being that it was written upon the mountain's heart.  And rightly does 
de Sobrel <a  href="Index_Ingenuous.html">note</a> that "dragon science could never have reached the heights 
it has if not for the [...] Index Ingenuous", as it was the latter text that revealed the 
long-lost hieroglyphic arts of the <a  href="Ergniramniphoniclufiville.html">Ergniramniphoniclufivillians</a>, 
whose city was discovered abandoned inside the mountain.  As an aside, it is important 
to note that de Sobrel is being completely literal here: the aforementioned arts made the 
upper reaches of the volcano passable to enterprising scholars for the first time.</p>
<p>Set atop Woken God is the <a  href="Meteoric_Temple.html">Meteoric Temple</a>, the draconic monastery that many know as 
the Vaticant.  Though the dracomonks heavily encourage mortal study of the noble ones—
one recalls Hlurfo Heiferbane's somewhat cheeky jest that <i>frærthe glursha nel kibbtr poom 
enr sagatha simmimür</i> (though some, e.g. Hannon <i>et al</i>, have suggested he was actually 
making a veiled analogy about the tax policies of his day)—they are notoriously silent on 
the inner workings of their worship of the mountain, or of the Meteoric Order in general.</p>
<p>One cannot conclude an epigraph on the Woken God, of course, without quoting the final words 
of the esteemed explorer Zeminih Sutoba (CI #716, p. 30): </p>
<p><i>In all my living days, never have I seen such grandeur, a landmark ablaze with such beauty.  
Behold, she burns, and I am set alight.  Put me out, Senethal.  For God's sake, Senethal, 
stop writing and put me out.  Forget history, I'm on fire here.  Aruogarlagraeh.</i> [Note: again, 
draconic transliteration is difficult, and scholars are divided on what exactly Sutoba was 
trying to say.  For further discussion see Gloorville's <i>Rise and Fall</i>: <i>The Fates and 
Fame of the Great Eastern Explorers</i>.]</p>
