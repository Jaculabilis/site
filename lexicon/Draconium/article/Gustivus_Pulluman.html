<p>Gustivus Pulluman is a legendary chef currently living between the Underground Academy, his primary restaurant in The Igneous City, and a private island in the <a  href="Scorialic_Sea.html">Scorialic Sea</a>. Despite being 79 (Tickets for his 80th Birthday Bash available now! Featuring <a  href="The_Beautiful_Cupcakes_of_Dr._Ophelia_Gumphry_from_the_Undergrou.html">The Beautiful Cupcakes of Dr. Ophelia Gumphry from the Underground Academy for Gifted Minds</a>™  and his very own grilled <a  href="Elder_Sea_Serpent.html">Elder Sea Serpent</a>), Gustivus doesn't look a day over 30! What's his secret? Many think it's his impressive diet, others say he charmed Time itself, and some think he was just born perfect.</p>
<p>Gustivus Pulluman was born in the small seaside town of Vertrouw de Vogelsniet, where his mother introduced him to the family trade of hunting and preparing <a  href="Yellow_wyrmidon.html">yellow wyrmidon</a>. A simple existence, but Gustivus yearned for more. One expedition, he discovered a hidden cave, and in it, a <a  href="Kevyn3A_Drogoanthropic_Hybrid_26_Class_E2809CBE2809D_DooshbC3A4g.html">slumbering drogoanthropic hybrid</a>. Gustivus snuck in, taking but one item from the hoard. As he crossed the room back towards the exit, a rustling sound from behind froze him in his tracks. The dragon hadn't fully awoken, but the sentient tail had, and slashed out, taking off Gustivus' right arm. He barely managed to swim to shore, clutching his prize. Stumbling back, he saw his town was no more. An elder sea serpent was destroying his humble, beloved fishing village! Gripping his now only possession, Gustivus slew the dragon single-handed, an act which by no means went unnoticed. A Firemind Union, The Bardslayers, finding the wreckage of the village, graciously replaced his arm with a cutting-edge, mechanical stand-in, for naught but a simple favor later.</p>
<p>Thrilling, incredible adventures aren't all Gustivus is known for. Since that eventful day, Gustivus' profound cooking expertise has won international acclaim. Two of his definitive cookbooks, featuring sensational tales of Gustivus’ travels, are international bestsellers. <a  href="Seasonal_Enrollment_for_the_Underground_Academy_for_Gifted_Minds.html">The Underground Academy</a> has awarded him an honorary, never-before-extant culinary doctorate for his contributions to their new Baking division. </p>
<p>You can't make a proper omelette without breaking a few dragon eggs, and thus it is unsurprising that there are a couple people who don't wholly approve of the Pulluman brand. Some undoubtedly unfair criticisms leveled point to that one time Gustivus needed a breath of fresh air because by God that conference was stuffy as all hell, and a couple birds got in, or when I mistook one lunch for my own, and that other time where my unbridled success led to the extinction of some regrettably delicious species (whose extinctions were probably really the result of some other factor). But it is undeniable that Gustivus is the most influential man of our time, and as long as he's there with that award-winning smile and award-winning roast, nothing can truly ever go too wrong.</p>
