<div class="contentblock"><h1>Literarosphere</h1><p>One of the many, <i>many</i> semi-apocalyptic devices constructed by <a  href="Kelorna_the_Extremely_Confused.html">Kelorna the Extremely Confused</a> 
over the years, the <b>Literarosphere</b> was a compendium of knowledge intended to provide a 
companion perspective to the <a  href="Codex_Ingenuous.html">Codex Ingenuous</a>.  The exact technical specifications of 
the device remain mercifully unknown, but it's likely that it functioned similarly to a 
<a  href="Brainsplainer.html">brainsplainer</a>, as the brainsplainer development process began with salvaged 
pieces of the Literarosphere.  However, Kelorna's intent for the device is on record:</p>
<p><i>Mwa ha ha!  For too long, that fool Guage has hidden the secrets of the Codex from me!  
But he was too short-sighted, for merely relocating the Codex</i>[1] <i>is not enough to stop me from 
collecting all of it and seizing the Great Secret!  With this device, I shall reach into 
history itself and reconstruct the Codex—and THEN, I shall RULE THE WORLD!  BWA HA HA HA!  
COWER, MORTALS!  COWER AND BEHOLD!</i>[2]  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, while it seems Kelorna intended the Literarosphere to view the historical record
passively, it the device was actually able to effect changes in the past—a possibility
it appears <a  href="What-could-go-wrong-ism.html">she did not consider</a>.  Naturally, the device subsequently 
exploded.  It is impossible to prove <i>which</i> changes occurred as a result of the Literarosphere, 
as at this point they have always been as they are, but it is a safe bet that any <a  href="Scorialic_Sea.html">use</a> 
of <a  href="Unanimite.html">unanimite</a> before its invention in 1901 is the result of temporally-displaced fragments 
of the Literarosphere.</p>
<p>The Literarosphere was built after the failure of the Omnihammer (a device to turn everything 
into nails), and was followed by an unnamed and swiftly abandoned plot to "drown the world 
in syrup".[3]</p>

<p>[1] Kelorna refers here to the then-recent theft of half the Codex by <a  href="Thrognurith_the_Dragon_Rider.html">Thrognurith the Dragon Rider</a>.  No connection between Thrognurith and Guage has ever been proven, and 
given Kelorna's characteristic paranoia, it is generally assumed that Guage (circa 2nd 
century) had little or nothing to do with the theft (which occurred in the 18th century).</p>
