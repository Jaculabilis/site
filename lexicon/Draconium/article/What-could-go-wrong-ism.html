<p>hey everyone! This made me LOL super hard so I had to share!! have a blessed day!</p>
<p><b><i>4 Soul-Bending Facts About What-could-go-wrong-ism That Can’t Possibly Go Wrong™</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>1.</i></b> <i>As most are aware, ‘What-could-go-wrong-ism’ is a fundamental mindset shared by dragon scientists. Its mastery and continual exercise are essential to understanding dragons – After all, if any </i>one<i> possibility of catastrophe could be predicted in the act of examining, discussing, or even thinking about dragons, scholars might abandon their studies out of fear. However, by professing absolute perplexity toward any specific danger, scholars march bravely on into the blazing unknown. What Could Go Wrong, indeed!</i></p>
<p><b><i>2.</i></b> <i>The phrase “What could go wrong?” is supposedly used in casual conversation by dragons with the intention of distracting the other party. While the question is pondered (since all inquiries from dragons are assumed profoundly meaningful), the dragon gains a brief moment to telepathically invite guests to the imminent barbecue of their conversational partner. Neat, huh? What </i>Could<i> Go Wrong?</i></p>
<p><b><i>3.</i></b> <i>What-could-go-wrong-ism also permits advances in the study of <a href="Protoellipses.html">Protoellipses</a>. Some scientists suggest that the “psychic impressions” crystallized in each protoellipsis could be superposed to reconstruct a complete and working (but somewhat crispy) consciousness to tell us of the missing keys. Of course, this might also result in a sapient, mind-ravaging horror – but fear not! After all, What Could Go Wrong?</i></p>
<p><b><i>4.</i></b> <i>One popular theory for the sudden inactivity of <a href="The_Financiers_Invisible.html">The Financiers Invisible</a> is that the moment of the organization’s very creation was half-stolen from them, causing them to be half-erased from history. Of course, dear reader, you may be concerned that setting a precedent for this kind of ex machina time-travel into the <a href="Literarosphere.html">Literarosphere</a> may be dangerously exploitable. However, thanks to the convenient doctrine we so cherish, there’s no need to worry –  What Could Go Wrong?</i></p>
