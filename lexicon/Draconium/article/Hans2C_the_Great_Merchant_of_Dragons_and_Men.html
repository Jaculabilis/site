<div class="contentblock"><h1>Hans, the Great Merchant of Dragons and Men</h1><p>As we know, there are still five hundred and four and four fifths keys missing to the great Guage Enigma. Recent speculators believe that our best lead to find no less than twenty seven more keys lies with Hans, the Great Merchant of Dragons and Men. </p>
<p>Hans, brother of <a  href="Mean_Petrine_the_Stealing_Machine.html">Mean Petrine the Stealing Machine</a>, is the only merchant to have ever been rumored to deal with both humans and dragons alike. As a <a  href="Fireminds.html">firemind</a>, Hans had the ability to speak to all dragons which no doubt made selling and buying from them a much simpler task. Reason to believe that Hans may have a substantial number of the missing keys is drawn from a few eyewitness accounts, one stated as follows:</p>
<p>“I saw Hans, the Great Merchant of Dragons and Men, he was walking around in golden shoes and dragon scale garments when I heard him say, ‘I’ve got no less than twenty seven keys to the Guage Enigma’ which led me to believe that he must have no less than twenty seven keys to the Guage Enigma. He also has a woman with him, I think her name was…” </p>
<p>The account ends there as the records have been torn and the rest was stolen.</p>
<p>Hans is often rumored to have been immortal or otherwise dead. His home rests on the base of <a  href="The_Woken_God.html">The Woken God</a> and if there is any hope to finding these twenty seven more keys he is thought to have, it would be found there in his home where he is either alive, dead, or not there at all.</p>
