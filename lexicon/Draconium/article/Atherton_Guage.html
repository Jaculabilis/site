<div class="contentblock"><h1>Atherton Guage</h1><p>A quixotic and storied figure in <a  href="Codex_Ingenuous.html">Codex</a> lore, <b>Atherton Guage</b> is the 
subject of so many wildly varying tales that all of them cannot possibly true—a fact, it 
must be said, that draws Bardslayer attention like bloody water draws sea wyrms.  Given 
extant writings on the man, I will merely offer a brief summary.</p>
<p>Our actual evidence of Guage's life is scant.  We know from the Codex Ingenuous that he was 
a prominent figure in <a  href="Ergniramniphoniclufiville.html">Ergniramniphoniclufiville</a> and a contemporary—and political opponent—of 
<a  href="Kelorna_the_Extremely_Confused.html">Kelorna the Extremely Confused</a>.  Though referred to only as the "Wheelmind" in the Codex, 
comments by Kelorna in the present day confirm that Guage was her primary opponent during 
final batch of experiments that are presumed to have resulted in Ergniramniphoniclufiville's 
disappearance.  Unfortunately, most of these comments are off-handed references, collected 
from the transcripts of her characteristic monologues while e.g. unleashing another doomsday 
device or blowing up the current head of government.  And since <a  href="The_Educational_Exploitation_of_Dragon_Fire.html">undergoing dragonfire-induced 
radical behavior modification therapy</a>, Kelorna 
has ceased being <i>ingenuously</i> "extremely confused", and is now, to all appearances, <i>actually</i>
extremely confused.  It seems unlikely she will be able to provide further information.</p>
<p>Guage's most notable accomplishment, however, needs no immortal supervillain to confirm its 
existence.  To prevent the power of the <a  href="Gauge_Enigma.html">Gauge Enigma</a> from falling into the wrong hands 
(that is, Kelorna's), he brought forth a great working that remains without equal to this day.  
Lirian Inkbowels put it particularly well: </p>
<p><i>Dark the brow, quick the fingers of the Wheelmind as raised he a bulwark 'gainst the unworthy.  
Wheels of fire issued forth from the ground, and the Gauge Enigma</i>[1]<i> was enshrined in the sky, 
warded forever.</i>  (CI #209, p. 147)</p>
<p>I hardly need explain at this point that this is why the all-encompassing network of metal 
gears in the sky is known as the "Guage Enigma".  The ever-shifting patterns among the gears 
make for an excellent deterrent for those like Kelorna, who is bad at math.  However, it 
is unlikely it will stop those like the estimable D. R. Loblaw, whose 
<a  href="Epiliton.html">groundbreaking</a> <a  href="Haiku_of_Keysmith_Xemoniphon_the_Elder.html">work</a> 
on the Guage Enigma would surely advance the field if he were invited to conferences anymore.[2]</p>

<p>[1] Some translators alternatively render the phrase <i>εωερυβοδυ διεσ</i> as "Great Secret".  
For a number of reasons, the Sel and Kimoth translation, which I use here, elected to stick 
with the vernacular.</p>
<p>[2] Alas, part of this is his fault.  I am told that instead of presenting, he just stands 
on the podium and mumbles about numbers.</p>
