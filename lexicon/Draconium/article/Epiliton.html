<div class="contentblock"><h1>Epiliton</h1><p>The third of five hundred and seventeen keys to the famed Guage Enigma, it remains one of the twelve and one-fifth keys to have been identified and archived. Known mainly for its streamed form and blocky cuts, much ink has been spilt into the anatomy of its overall shape. However, what has not been commented upon in enough volume is the nature of its teeth. Containing no less than 83 <a  href="Protoellipses.html">protoellipses</a>, its craftsmanship remains unparalleled (aside from the <a  href="Key_of_Xemonides.html">Key of Xemonides</a> for obvious reasons), leading some scholars to posit (incorrectly) that this key may have been used as a prototype for a whole range of novel keys. However, upon looking closer to the shape and form of the teeth itself, one can distinctly detect influences from keys 279 and 14, though it undeniably improved vastly upon their character.</p>
<p>Alas, were these keys not lost to history we would perhaps be able to unravel some of the origins of the inventions of these keys. Who made them, for what purpose, diabolical or benevolent, and why were they so careless in their storage of such priceless artefacts? Such questions baffle scholars to this day and may never be answered until we properly catalogue the remaining five hundred and four and four fifths keys, truly the challenge of our lifetime.</p>
