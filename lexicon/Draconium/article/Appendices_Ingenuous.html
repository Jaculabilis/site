<div class="contentblock"><h1>Appendices Ingenuous</h1><p>The Appendices Ingenuous are a large collection of documents from <a  href="Ergniramniphoniclufiville.html">Ergniramniphoniclufiville</a> before its mysterious depopulation. Although less famous than the <a  href="Codex_Ingenuous.html">Codex Ingenuous</a>, the Appendices contain a good deal more information, as the Codex consists entirely of diary entries, and the Appendices include everything from religious texts to take-out menus. Fortunately, the <a  href="Index_Ingenuous.html">Index Ingenuous</a> exists to orient those who may attempt to parse such, even if the Index is, in part, misplaced, and almost as confusing as the Appendices themselves. It has been remarked that one who masters such navigation may be able to claim distinction in any number of draco-sciences, regardless of other knowledge or qualifications.</p>
<p>The location of the Appendices Ingenuous is a complicated matter, but it was not always such. Upon its discovery and compilation, it seems that various documents spread throughout varies universities and academies, with a longstanding pact that any resource must be accessible, in some form or another, to any academic in decent standing. This could be enforced with the full Index, as it detailed where any article may be found. Alas, such is not the case, and since, many articles have disappeared from their institutions. In cases where the loss is discovered, the curators unequivocally point to <a  href="Mean_Petrine_the_Stealing_Machine.html">Mean Petrine the Stealing Machine</a> as the culprit, and refuse to comment on the connections between the missing articles and stunningly original academic work produced thereafter. It should come as a great relief to many that many originals of the Appendices are currently stored in the impenetrable Underground Academy, with their strong focus on legalistic ethics and very passable cafeteria.</p>
<p>The Appendices’ size is directly tied to its source and history. Since, in its time, dragon and human academics often worked together, much of the more academic work is, in fact, translations of other texts. However, the non-academic work should not be undervalued. With such documents, we gain a clearer picture of the most important heroes of the past, contextualization of the Codex, and some of our only information on dracosociology and the restaurants of the day. </p>
<p>Upon attempting to engage with the text, it should be noted that the units specified often do not correlate with our present-day units, despite similar naming conventions, and this separation only worsens when trying to convert between thus. Even seemingly objective measures, like proportions in the recipe-books, fail to produce repeatable results, despite being highly consistent throughout.</p>
