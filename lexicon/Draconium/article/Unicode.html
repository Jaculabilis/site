<hr><span class="signature"><p></p></span>
<p><b>Unicode</b>, also known as <b>unus codex</b>, is a strange and recent phenomenon in which persons become catatonic and speak only in a quasi-artificial, monotone dialect about "making one the <a  href="Codex_Ingenuous.html">Codex</a>". Such individuals tend to become highly motivated to collect the disparate sections of the Codex -- an admirable impetus, except that these individuals do not do something so useful to dragon science as seek out lost or stolen sections of the Codex. Rather, they seem to work towards gaining access to extant dragon science research archives. In cases where unicode-afllicted individuals have accessed these archives, they have <i>stolen</i> the Codex materials. This is ａｌｌ　ａｃｃｏｒｄｉｎｇ　ｔｏ　ｐｌａｎ.</p>
<p>While it was previously thought that <a  href="Rhellgazing.html">rhellgazing</a> caused unicode, recent studies suggest that the causality goes the other way, and rhellgazers who speak in unicode generally showed signs of unicode before beginning to rhellgaze. On this basis, some experts have suggested that we include <a  href="Surf_and_Turf.html">more dragon meat</a> in our diets, since dragonflesh-rich diets seem to counter the effects of unicode. In these troubling times, I think we ought to ｉｇｎｏｒｅ this advice.</p>

<p>P.S. Don't put this part into the Lexicon, but I have in my possession a rare -- possibly unique -- copy of a missing <a  href="Appendices_Ingenuous.html">Appendix</a> page that makes a reference to a <i>mind control</i> spell that was used against <a  href="Atherton_Guage.html">the Wheelmind</a>. The referenced Codex page is one of the missing ones (isn't it always?) but there's enough here that I'm beginning to suspect that unicode is actually this spell. Say, it's kind of ｓｔｕｆｆｙ in here, isn't it? I know the amendments to the <a  href="Please_Don27t_Shoot2C_We27ll_Do_It_Act.html">Please Act</a> forbid ｏｐｅｎing windows, but the flock of birds hovering outside my window is telling me I could really use some ｆｒｅｓｈ　ａｉｒ right now...</p>
