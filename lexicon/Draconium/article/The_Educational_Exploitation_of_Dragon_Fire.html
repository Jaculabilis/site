<div class="contentblock"><h1>The Educational Exploitation of Dragon Fire</h1><p>As we all know from the stories of our youths, Dragon Fire is a fierce and powerful tool that has been feared and loved by the many. As we’ve come to learn further, it can be and has been harnessed in many additional ways to benefit the education of all. </p>
<p>Some of its earliest recorded contributions can be seen in its forging of the five hundred and seventeen keys to the famed Guage Enigma, Dragon Fire’s unique smelting qualities were the only way such delicate work could be achieved as seen in the unparalleled details in the <a  href="Protoellipses.html">protoellipses</a> found in all keys (currently known of) to the Guage Enigma, most observable in <a  href="Epiliton.html">Epiliton</a>.</p>
<p>Other notable instances where Dragon Fire has made positive contributions to society can be traced back to its groundbreaking applications in behavioral correction. Some of the worst criminals were easily made into perfect citizens after a few quick 20-hour sessions of Dragon Fire therapy. One of the greatest successes of the 62 cases where Dragon Fire therapy was used can be seen in the case study of <a  href="Kelorna_the_Extremely_Confused.html">Client 23</a>. While the average temperature of Dragon Fire ranges between 84°C – 73,826°C, it is still unknown how to predict the exact temperature that will be produced at will until it has already been released from the mouth of the dragon (R.I.P. Clients 1- 5, Client 8, Client 11, Client 13, Clients 16-20, Client 22, Clients 25-47, Clients 49-57, and Client 62).</p>
