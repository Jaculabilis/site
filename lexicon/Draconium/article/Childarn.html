<div class="contentblock"><h1>Childarn</h1><p>It is frightening the extents to which dragon science will go. The Childarn population was conceived in a glass tube (hence their <a  href="Yellow_wyrmidon.html">low quality</a> of meat). Their intelligence is unparalleled, and after escaping, due in part to <a  href="Please_Don27t_Shoot2C_We27ll_Do_It_Act.html">muscae uprising</a>, they became relatively integrated into society. There have been attempts to study them, but the lifespan of a Childarn researcher is significantly shorter than most.</p>
<p>Of greater interest is the psychical elements of the Childarn. Their teeth are used in the construction of <a  href="Protoellipses.html">protoellipses</a>, and it can be no accident that Childarn have varying amounts of teeth per each individual, but all have a prime number amount, which must be related to the consequent power of prime numbered protoellipsed keys. And here we have arrived at yet another metakey.</p>
<p>If we are able to unlock the relationship between the Childarn, their <a  href="Surf_and_Turf.html">diet</a>, their prime numbered teeth, and ellipses, it may in fact be enough to unlock the Guage, or at least begin production of keys again. Only a perfect square amount of time will tell.</p>
