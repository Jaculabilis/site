<h1>Kelorna the Extremely Confused</h1>
<p>Widely considered the founder of dragon science, <b>Kelorna the Extremely Confused</b> was a <a href="Ergniramniphoniclufiville.html">Ergniramniphoniclufivillian</a> who, unlike the other members of her village, was not a Firemind. This made her a pariah among the Ergniramniphoniclufivillians. Isolated from her community, she undertook a program of systematic study that would later form the foundations of dragon science. This earned her the ire of her village, as her diary entries in the <a href="Codex_Ingenuous.html">Codex</a> reveal, culimating in some sort of crisis that coincided with the village's disappearance. The strategies of social enginering she developed, which she called <b>"ingenuosity"</b>, have continued to shape the culture of dragon science up to the present day. Though the normal sense of the word gives a sense of innocence and a lack of duplicity, Kelorna describes ingenuosity as being like a dragon's smile: shiny and spotless, but full of daggers.</p>
<p>The true nature of ingenuosity remains something of a unacknowledged consensus. Due to restrictions on studying the Codex itself, the public at large remains ignorant of how explicitly subterfuge is detailed in it. Eggies[1] usually learn quickly through harrowing experience or stolen Kelorna scans. Among professionals, her ingenuous spirit remains alive and well: At the annual Symposium for Extreme Deconfusion held in her honor, the conference rooms are soundproof and fireproof, and fewer researchers leave than enter.</p>
<p>More subtly, consider the rate at which researchers are eaten by their lab's <a href="Childarn.html">childarn</a> population: despite a chidl being little more than a dragon head with stubby legs, professional dracoscientists are frequently devoured by them just before major research projects are published, which are then taken over by their postdocs. Little is found of these victims except for singed clothing and recently-filed succession papers.</p>
