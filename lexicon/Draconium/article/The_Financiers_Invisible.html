<p>[1] Okay, I think we're safe here. For some reason, the taxmen can't read footnotes. The <b>Financiers Invisible </b> are a secret society of beings whose original forms are unknown. A freak <a  href="Literarosphere.html">Literarosphere</a> accident resulted in their physically visible forms being erased, but they remain with us in the form of ghostly psychic revenants, forever wailing about incentive taxes and departmental audits.</p>
<p>[2] Since they're invisible, it is difficult to evaluate the innumerable claims that the Financiers are responsible for this or that historical event. Such claims are usually dismissed as just-so stories, but some have gained minor traction among dracohistorians. The most well-supported of these is the recent theory that the Financiers funded the <a  href="Hans2C_the_Great_Merchant_of_Dragons_and_Men.html">Great Merchant</a>, explaining how he was able to make such risky business ventures.</p>
<p>[3] There are few records of attempted resistance against the Financiers, but no records of a Financier ever being killed. This has led to a variety of folk tales about their resilience, most popularly that only the way to kill one is the intense flame of a <a  href="Loong.html">Loong</a> held by a pure maiden.</p>
<p>[4] We don't thank him for the warning that we're next, as long as Pulluman doesn't <a  href="Please_Don27t_Shoot2C_We27ll_Do_It_Act.html">open the damn window again</a>. Ilron, did you buy those padlocks yet?</p>
