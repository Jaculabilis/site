<h1>Brainsplainer</h1>
<p>Of all the wooly hoaxes that the so-called "academy" "elites" have pulled over the eyes of the public, no hoax is so wooly nor so far pulled as the <b>"brainsplainer"</b>. Touted by its snake-oil salesmen as a way to read <a href="Protoellipses.html">protoellipses</a> without succumbing to <a href="Lexicon_Draconium.html">"key madness"</a>, these <i>conspirators</i> (for that is the only word appropriate to the occasion) claim that the technology has antecedents in the <a href="Literarosphere.html">Literarosphere</a> of <a href="Kelorna_the_Extremely_Confused.html">Kelorna the Extremely Confused</a>. Tell me, when was the last time anything built by that madwoman worked? Hogwash, the lot of it. I've disassambled a brainsplainer, and I can't tell what anything inside it does.</p>
<p>These carnival hooligans haven't stopped at pushing their wares only on <a href="Guage_Enigma.html">Guage Key</a> researchers, either. The latest "studies" (ha! as if) claim that even reading the <a href="Codex_Ingenuous.html">Codex</a> should be done with a brainsplainer, due to proto-protoelliptic effects etched into the magmatic pages themselves. They <i>say</i> that the existence of these effects is a clue to uncovering the catastrophe that destroyed <a href="Ergniramniphoniclufiville.html">Ergniramniphoniclufiville</a> -- but wouldn't that be just <i>so</i> convenient for these "researchers", who no doubt will take such a "result" as an opportunity to ask for more funding?</p>
<p>In reality, there is probably no such thing as protoelliptic psychic shock. It is a lie sold by dragonflesh butchers to hype up their wares, eaten up by consolation-prize dracoscientists to explain why their protoelliptic research projects keep falling through. News flash: not everyone can do dracoscience with the big boys. I've read every protosllipsis on <a href="Epiliton.html">Epiliton</a> twice, and only had three nosebleeds -- and one of those was just because of the pain medication I was snorting. If there were such a thing as key madness, I would have it in spades, but I don't. Explain <i>that</i>, you third-rate <i>hacks</i>.</p>

<p>P.S. 'Twas I who stole that <a href="Unanimite.html">unanimite</a> lunchbox from the office fridge, and no, I'm not giving it back. Ever since I've started using it as a helmet, the voices have gotten quieter. If you want it back, you'll have to pry it from my cold, oddly-vibrating hands.</p>
