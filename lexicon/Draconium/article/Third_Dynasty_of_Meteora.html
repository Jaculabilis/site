<div class="contentblock"><h1>Third Dynasty of Meteora</h1><p>The Third Dynasty of Meteora is universally renowned for it's poetry and art. 
While efforts have been made to preserve these cherished gifts of the past, it is known that the artistic type are a jealous and bitter people in the shadow of <a  href="The_Woken_God.html">The Woken God</a>. Many speculate that this may have to do with the <a  href="Rhellgazing.html">mind altering effects of the temple walls</a>.This is of course seen in the fact that all records of the second halves of the first and second dynasty’s records are missing and there are no records of the 4th-9th dynasty's’ accomplishments either.</p>
<p>In truth, no one really knows what dynasty we are currently in anymore, thanks to <a  href="Mean_Petrine_the_Stealing_Machine.html">Mean Petrine the Stealing Machine</a>. The very few records left behind from the third dynasty are mostly those of <a  href="Haiku_of_Keysmith_Xemoniphon_the_Elder.html">Xemoniphon</a> who was a striking seventeen years old at the time of his death. This was an exceptionally long life for someone at this time.</p>
<p>Other notable discoveries from the third dynasty:<br>
*Most draconic or “firetongue” translations follow either haiku format, iambic pentameter, or are meant to be sung<br>
*Dragons cannot fly backwards<br>
*With the creation of every key, there must be a life paid in sacrifice to it's creation<br>
*The term “CONCERNED” is actually from root “CONSCERNUS” in draconic language meaning “SLOW MINDED, DAFT, or LEARNING IMPAIRED”</p>
