<h1>Please Don't Shoot, We'll Do It Act</h1>
<p>A historic moment for the annual Dragon Science Symposium was recorded when a new Act was signed into place known as the “Please Don’t Shoot, We’ll Do It” Act.</p>
<p>It had been a rather dull but sunny day as the leading dracologists from around the globe met to discuss a variety of menial matters when <a href="Gustivus_Pulluman.html">one dracologist</a> went to open the windows and let the sun in. Outside were thousands of ｃｏｍｐｌｅｔｅｌｙ　ｎｏｎ－ｔｈｒｅａｔｅｎｉｎｇ birds, armed with flame throwers, hovering in the shape of a massive dragon. It would soon be learned that they acquired these flamethrowers by raiding a nearby military complex which left hundreds of soldiers de-ｌｉｇｈｔｅｄ　ｗｉｔｈ　ｔｈｅｉｒ　ｍａｎｎｅｒｓ　ａｎｄ　ｃｏｍｐｌｅｔｅｌｙ　ｗｉｌｌｉｎｇ　ｔｏ　ｐａｒｔ　ｗｉｔｈ　ａｎｙ　ａｎｄ　ａｌｌ　ｗｅａｐｏｎｓ　ｄｅｓｉｒｅｄ．</p>
<p>These types of birds in this arrangement would come to be known as the <a href="Ordo_Draco.html"><b>muscae</b></a>. The muscates that were present that day had some very compelling arguments as to their ｒｉｇｈｔｆｕｌ　ｃｌａｓｓｉｆｉｃａｔｉｏｎ, compelling dracologists to amend the <a href="Ordo_Draco.html">Ordo Draco</a> and include <b>muscae</b> within it. This of course gave the <b>muscae</b> full access to the <a href="Meteoric_Temple.html">Meteoric Temple</a>, for obvious reasons. Other amendments to this act included that no one else was allowed to ｏｐｅｎ　ｔｈｅ　ｗｉｎｄｏｗｓ anymore. This was decidedly the best way to prevent any further tense discussions between the dracologists and ＡＬＭＩＧＨＴＹ　ＭＵＳＣＡＥ.</p>
<p>Since the “Please Don’t Shoot, We’ll Do It” act, <a href="1b4b80d88d71d77a.html">dracologists insist that we have nothing further to worry about in regards to the <b>muscae</b></a>.</p>
<p>Hmm, my head hurts.
