<div class="contentblock"><h1>Fireminds</h1><p>A Firemind is an individual gifted with an innate ability to converse with dragons in a soul-based linguistic pattern known as Firetongue. Although this used to be a universal (well, <a  href="Kelorna_the_Extremely_Confused.html">near-universal</a>) trait, since the collapse of <a  href="Ergniramniphoniclufiville.html">Ergniramniphoniclufiville</a>, such persons have become a rarity, with recent censuses suggesting an occurrence of approximately 1:29. </p>
<p>To-do: Ask Heraclitivian about that recent study, the one regarding communication with <a  href="Ordo_Draco.html">Muscae</a> when he gets back. Bluh. That guy gives me a headache.</p>
<p>A Firemind differs not only in their ability to converse with dragons, but in the very way they think. Even the few Fireminds who do not take careers directly related to dragons tend to find success in highly bureaucratic fields, such as in library science and governmental agencies. Since Fireminds tend to excel in unconventional areas of life, their specialized communities and abilities have led to a somewhat contentious division of culture between those who are not Fireminds and those who are. It is not uncommon for regional folklore to demonize those who can speak to dragons. Certain tales call them "soulsuckers" and "lizard-people", and more modern insults attack their organizational tendencies, comparing it to the stereotypical dragon horde. As a result, certain anti-defamation unions were founded to protest this mistreatment. One notable Firemind union, The Dooshbags, even bear one such slur with a sense of pride. Others, like the Bardslayers, try to influence political and social movements in different, subtle ways. And of course, Fireminds have their own set of <a  href="Talonstain.html">slurs for those they deem unimportant</a>.</p>
<p>Although not many Fireminds choose to become chefs (for quite a few reasons, and with the notable exception of <a  href="The_Beautiful_Cupcakes_of_Dr._Ophelia_Gumphry_from_the_Undergrou.html">my good friend Ophelia</a>), many become incredible, if lofty and egocentric, food critics, perhaps owing to their strong <a  href="Ontological_cost.html">ontological forces</a> (To-do: Need to cite Dean Loblaw's mathy thingy here).</p>
<p>When not involved in dragon’s-rights campaigns, Fireminds do important work and are integral members of every community. Through them, we gain key insights into biology, culture, and bureaucracies. Just because they’re a little awkward and a little weird and can occasionally cause your brainstem to feel like it’s vibrating doesn’t make them any less of people.</p>
